title: Experimenting with a 1-year sabbatical
date: 2021-06-04
summary: >
  For my 32nd birthday I'm leaving Google (after 6 years)
  and experimenting with a 1-year sabbatical. This post
  outlines my motivations, plans, hopes, and fears.

<aside>
  By the way, when I say "sabbatical" I simply mean
  a period of time to pursue my own interests. In some
  professions or parts of the world a sabbatical means
  a paid leave. In my case I have completely exited
  my job and will be living off savings. The phrase
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_year">gap year</a>
  is also an accurate description of what I'm doing.
</aside>

I'm writing this post for a few reasons:

* Quite a few people have told me that they are considering
  doing something similar so I figured I should share my situation,
  thoughts, and experiences to help others
  decide if a sabbatical is worthwhile for them.
* It'll be interesting to note my thoughts before and after
  the experience. I will post a blog at the end of the sabbatical
  (June 2022) and perhaps one 3 years after the experience (June 2025)
  to reflect on the long-term effects of the experiment. You
  can add your email to this
  <a href="https://forms.gle/Sdn8myogji11GtSz5">form</a> if you'd like to
  receive emails when I publish these posts.
* I want to normalize the idea of a regularly recurring gap year
  for adults. In my case I might try to do this every 10 years or so
  (9 or 10 years of working and then 1 year of sabbatical).

## Motivations

I've been thinking about doing a sabbatical for a few years now.
Here are the circumstances that finally led me to take the plunge.

### Kids

The biggest factor was kids. I plan on having kids in the
next 5 years. If/when that happens I will have much more need
for steady income, benefits, etc. I realized that it was
somewhat now or never. It would probably never be easier
to take a sabbatical than it is right now. Not for the next
20 or 30 years, at least.

### Money & time

Idea 1: I read somewhere that you can summarize the challenges
of each phase of life in terms of a tradeoff between
money, energy, and time. Young people have energy and time
but no money. Middle-aged people have money and energy but no time.
Old people have money and time but no energy.

Idea 2: Money is important to me.


Money, energy, time: pick 2. young people have energy and time
but no money. middle aged people have money and energy but
no time. old people have money and time but no energy. time
is my most precious commodity. I have enough money. I have
energy and I realize how much of a blessing it is to wake up
without pain


There are some things that I need to do that I simply do not
have time/energy to do when I have a full-time job. Grandpa's
autobiography.

Let me share a couple of independent ideas about money & time
and then synthesize them at the end of this section.

### Identity & relationships

This sabbatical is also somewhat of an exercise in voluntarily
giving up my identity. Let me explain this by way of some
personaly history. When I was a teenager I rollerbladed a lot.
Grinding rails, jumping stairs, stuff like that. I gave it up
after college and focused on my career. On social media I still
follow my old skating friends who have kept at it. It's safe to
say they have much richer friendships and possibly enjoyment
of life than I currently have. Anyone who was obsessed with
skateboarding, rollerblading, skiing, surfing, etc. will know
what I'm talking about. Hanging out at a beautiful outdoor space, drinking beers,
barbecuing, challenging your body, getting into that flow state
that comes with adrenaline and danger

Voluntarily giving up my identity. It's better than having it
ripped off involuntarily. I used to skate. On social media
I still follow my old skating friends who have kept at it.
It's safe to say they have a richer friendships that I currently
do. Now that I don't have the fancy career, who am I? 
I de-prioritized friendships and focused on career




## Fears & costs

If I could travel through time I think I
Would tell myself from the past
You'll be fine

Only If by Steve Lacy

https://youtu.be/ODQLN3ghuj4

What you don't hear is the voice of fear
When you get past that is when your life appears

Life comes at you, though. A family member lost their job. I'm not
in a great position to support them anymore. If more stuff like that
happens, sabbatical will be very stressful

How did we get here? Google compensated me well enough that
I am able to live off savings 

A desire to aim bigger. Yet I'm under no delusion that
I'll be able to match the compensation that Google provided

It was very difficult to do because I had a "good" (use another word)
team, career growth opportunity, great compensations and benefits.
Fear of losing healthcare. As it turns out it seems possible to
get quality healthcare for not obscene amounts of money if you're abroad

If I could travel through time
I think I
Would tell myself from the past
You'll be fine

The fear of getting behind. Behind what? The rat race. Keeping up
with the Joneses. I think of my sabbatical as a bet that I
can re-enter the workforce in a year. Emphasis on bet.
I am very aware that the bet might now pay off.


I had a pang of regret about leaving Google. "Why didn't I keep the job and put hard limits on my involvement, and work towards securing other financial needs, like buying a home?" (A reminder to myself) Because that path is easier said than done. I wanted time to rest and study. I didn't want to spend my whole life "working" in one way or another. Why spend all of my 30s working towards the prospect of taking time off from work, when the reality is I can do it now? And furthermore, the future is not certain. There's no guarantee I will have the time/energy (or even money for that matter) to do this in the future.



## Opportunities & plans

One plus however is that no income means no income taxes

another factor is that although Google pays well, it will not provide the
kind of financial independence I aspire to, so I may as well see if I can create that myself.
like, it would be cool to one day completely design a dream home. google pays me well
but not that well. I might as well see if I can create that for myself.
I'm under no delusion that it will happen. But it's fun to try. Fortune favors the bold.

I don't pay tribute to the cult of Steve Jobs, but this quote
does give me courage:

When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world, try not to bash into the walls too much, try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money… but that's a very limited life. Life can be much broader. Once you discover one simple fact, and that is everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it. You can influence it. You can build your own things that other people can use. The minute you understand that you can poke life and something will pop out the other side, that you can change it, you can mold it, that's maybe the most important thing… to shakeoff this erroneous notion that life is there and you're just going to live in it versus embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it. I think that's very important and however you learn that, once you learn it, you'll want to change life and make it better because it's kind of messed up in a lot of ways. Once you learn that you'll never be the same again.

As an aside, it's ironic that Jobs is worshipped as a visionary
these days, yet in this very quote he warns against that type
of thinking

Joie de vivre.

Plan to focus on somethign each week

kkkkk

Plans for the future. Try to work at Google again in a year.
Or some other interesting company. 

Converting money into wealth of one kind or another.
Wealth is skills or things that increase your odds of survival
or enjoyment. first aid. piano. 

I'm partially doing this as a way to not be a slave to money.
I have a belief that my net worth should grow every quarter.
It has served me well and I plan on keeping that belief long-term.
psychological rebellion against focusing on money above everything else,
The problem is that the goal post is always moving. I never feel that I have saved enough


At the end of the day, when I think about taking a year for 
a true sabbatical, I'm full of excitement for the possibilities.
And when I think about staying at Google, the only thing that keeps me
there is fear of change, discomfort, or pain. By leaving now I assert 
that I have saved enough money for now. "This Must Be The Place" could 
be a good theme song for this leg of the journey.

Having a supportive partner was hugely helpful, could
not have done it without Gabi's support
