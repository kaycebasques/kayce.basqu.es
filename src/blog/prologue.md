I had a pang of regret about leaving Google. "Why didn't I keep the job and put hard limits on my involvement, and work towards securing other financial needs, like buying a home?" (A reminder to myself) Because that path is easier said than done. I wanted time to rest and study. I didn't want to spend my whole life "working" in one way or another. Why spend all of my 30s working towards the prospect of taking time off from work, when the reality is I can do it now? And furthermore, the future is not certain. There's no guarantee I will have the time/energy (or even money for that matter) to do this in the future.

Life comes at you, though. A family member lost their job. I'm not
in a great position to support them anymore. If more stuff like that
happens, sabbatical will be very stressful

Plan to focus on somethign each week

The fear of getting behind. Behind what? The rat race. Keeping up
with the Joneses. I think of my sabbatical as a bet that I
can re-enter the workforce in a year. Emphasis on bet.
I am very aware that the bet might now pay off.

It's somewhat now or never to do it if I have kids as planned
in the next 5 years

As I've told people, quite a few have told me that they have
been thinking about doing the same, or were jealous of my plans,
or are already doing it

Money, energy, time: pick 2. young people have energy and time
but no money. middle aged people have money and energy but
no time. old people have money and time but no energy. time
is my most precious commodity. I have enough money. I have
energy and I realize how much of a blessing it is to wake up
without pain

Voluntarily giving up my identity. It's better than having it
ripped off involuntarily. I used to skate. On social media
I still follow my old skating friends who have kept at it.
It's safe to say they have a richer friendships that I currently
do. Now that I don't have the fancy career, who am I? 
I de-prioritized friendships and focused on career

There are some things that I need to do that I simply do not
have time/energy to do when I have a full-time job. Grandpa's
autobiography.

How did we get here? Google compensated me well enough that
I am able to live off savings 

It was very difficult to do because I had a "good" (use another word)
team, career growth opportunity, great compensations and benefits.
Fear of losing healthcare. As it turns out it seems possible to
get quality healthcare for not obscene amounts of money if you're abroad

I'm partially doing this as a way to not be a slave to money.
I have a belief that my net worth should grow every quarter.
It has served me well and I plan on keeping that belief long-term.
psychological rebellion against focusing on money above everything else,
The problem is that the goal post is always moving. I never feel that I have saved enough

another factor is that although Google pays well, it will not provide the
kind of financial independence I aspire to, so I may as well see if I can create that myself.
like, it would be cool to one day completely design a dream home. google pays me well
but not that well. I might as well see if I can create that for myself.
I'm under no delusion that it will happen. But it's fun to try.

One plus however is that no income means no income taxes

A desire to aim bigger. Yet I'm under no delusion that
I'll be able to match the compensation that Google provided

I want to normalize the idea of a gap year for adults.

It could be a huge mistake, in which case I will let you
all know so that you can learn from my mistakes

I have a feeling that a lot of people are feeling similarly.
The fact is that covid prompted a lot of people to reflect
about life

Converting money into wealth of one kind or another.
Wealth is skills or things that increase your odds of survival
or enjoyment. first aid. piano. 

Plans for the future. Try to work at Google again in a year.
Or some other interesting company.

Having a supportive partner was hugely helpful, could
not have done it without Gabi's support

Motivations for doing this

Fears

Opportunities

At the end of the day, when I think about taking a year for 
a true sabbatical, I'm full of excitement for the possibilities.
And when I think about staying at Google, the only thing that keeps me
there is fear of change, discomfort, or pain. By leaving now I assert 
that I have saved enough money for now. "This Must Be The Place" could 
be a good theme song for this leg of the journey.

Steve Jobs quote helped me take the plunge:

When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world, try not to bash into the walls too much, try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money… but that's a very limited life. Life can be much broader. Once you discover one simple fact, and that is everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it. You can influence it. You can build your own things that other people can use. The minute you understand that you can poke life and something will pop out the other side, that you can change it, you can mold it, that's maybe the most important thing… to shakeoff this erroneous notion that life is there and you're just going to live in it versus embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it. I think that's very important and however you learn that, once you learn it, you'll want to change life and make it better because it's kind of messed up in a lot of ways. Once you learn that you'll never be the same again.
