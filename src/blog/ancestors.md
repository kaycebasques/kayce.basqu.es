title: You (maybe?) have thousands of ancestors from the 1600s

# {{ title }}

I usually think about lineages from the perspective of the ancestor. E.g. my
grandpa had 5 kids; those 5 kids produced 9 grandkids; those 9 grandkids
produced 3 great-grandkids (so far); 17 descendants in total.

Over the last few days, I've been having fun thinking about the situation in
reverse, from the perspective of the descendant. Here's a quote from *Genes:
A Very Short Introduction* by Jonathan Slack:

There's probably a point when the numbers get nonsensical, right? We double
the number of ancestors every generation. At what point does the number of
ancestors exceed the number of humans that were probably alive at that point
in time? I will surely mess up the math, but let's give it a shot. Slack
(the author, not the blackhole of knowledge) says that ten generations ago is
250-300 years, so let's take the low value (250) and assume 25 years between
each generation. We'll also assume that you were born today (happy birthday!):

If my calculations are correct, which they surely are not, then it seems like
the math [stops making sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r7X3f2gFz4&t=239s)
around 1300. [Estimates of historical world
population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimates_of_historical_world_population)
says that the world population around 1300 was between 300M and 500M, whereas my
hilariously flawed logic says that I should have more than 1B ancestors at that
point.

Regardless, I'm pretty sure the basic premise holds: you've got a lot of ancestors.
