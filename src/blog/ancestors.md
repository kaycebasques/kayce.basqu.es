It's natural for me to think about lineages from the perspective of the
ancestor. E.g. my grandpa had 5 kids; those 5 kids produced 9 grandkids; those
9 grandkids produced 3 great-grandkids (so far); 17 descendants in total.

Over the last few days, I've been getting a big kick out of thinking about
the situation in reverse, from the perspective of the descendant. Here's a quote
from *Genes: A Very Short Introduction* by Jonathan Slack:

> Also, when considering 'roots', some of the basic mathematics of inheritance
> needs to be borne in mind. With fully random matings the number of your
> ancestors doubles every generation. Ten generations ago (250-300 years) we
> might expect about 1,000 ancestors each contributing 0.1 percent of their
> total variants to your genome... when the number of ancestors exceeds 
> 2,000-3,000 (12 generations would be about 4,000), it is likely that some
> ancestral sections of DNA have been lost altogether... by about 15
> generations back many of the ancestors contribute no DNA variants at all but
> they are still ancestors on the lineage. So, even though we all have an
> ancestry running back to the origin of life on Earth, we do not necessarily
> have any DNA variants from most of our ancestors.
