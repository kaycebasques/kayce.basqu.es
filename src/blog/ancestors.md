# {{ title }}

I usually think about lineages from the perspective of the ancestor. E.g. my
grandpa had 5 kids; those 5 kids produced 9 grandkids; those 9 grandkids
produced 3 great-grandkids (so far); 17 descendants in total.

Over the last few days, I've been having fun thinking about the situation in
reverse, from the perspective of the descendant. Here's a quote from *Genes:
A Very Short Introduction* by Jonathan Slack:

(In the [original version of this post] I did a thought experiment here to calculate
when the number of ancestors starts to get nonsensical, i.e. if you double the
number of ancestors every generation there's a point where the number of ancestors
exceeds the total number of humans at that point. I've removed this thought experiment
because I think it distracts from my main idea. See the [Hacker News discussion].)

[pedigree collapse]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedigree_collapse

Your exact number of ancestors depends on how much [pedigree collapse] there
is in your lineage, but I'm pretty sure the basic premise of this blog post
holds: you've got a lot of ancestors.
