I studied history at UC Berkeley. After job hunting for a few months
I realized that I needed more marketable skill and experience. My
solution was to do lots of small writing contracts on oDesk (now
Upwork) and take computer science classes at my local community
college. I did that for a year and then got my first full-time job
at Arrayent, an internet of things platform. I worked there for 3
years and then Google poached me to work on its Web DevRel team. I
wrote [Chrome DevTools] and [Lighthouse] docs for 4 years, and then
for 2 years I managed Web DevRel's technical writers and led content
strategy for [web.dev]. After 6 years at Google I quit and took a
[sabbatical] for 9 months. I then re-joined Google in May 2022 to
work on [Fuchsia]. I'm now focused on hardware and low-level
software documentation as a staff-level individual contributor.
