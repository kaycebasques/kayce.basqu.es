## Career summary

[degree]: http://catalog.collegeofsanmateo.edu/current/programs/computer-science-applications-and-development-as.php

I studied history at UC Berkeley. After job hunting for a few months
I eventually realized that I needed more marketable skill and experience.
My solution to build up work experience was to take small contracts
on oDesk (now Upwork). It was there that I first discovered my passion
for technical writing, and that I was pretty good at it! At the same
time I took a lot of computer science night classes at my local
community college. I did that for a year and then I got my first
full-time job at Arrayent, an internet of things platform. I worked there
for 3 years and then Google poached me to work on its Web DevRel team. I wrote
[Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools) and
[Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview)
docs for 4 years, and then I managed Web DevRel's technical writers and
led content strategy  for [web.dev](https://web.dev) for 2 years. After 6
years at Google I quit and took a [sabbatical](/essays/sabbatical) for 9 months.
Then I re-joined Google in May 2022 to work on [Fuchsia](https://fuchsia.dev).
I'm now focused on hardware and low-level software documentation as a
staff-level individual contributor.
