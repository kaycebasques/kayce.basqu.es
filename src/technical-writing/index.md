# {{title}}

I am a professional technical writer. By "professional" I simply
mean that I have somehow convinced people to pay me to do it for
going on 10 years now.

## Career summary

[degree]: http://catalog.collegeofsanmateo.edu/current/programs/computer-science-applications-and-development-as.php

I studied history at UC Berkeley. I got my initial technical writing
experience taking contracts on oDesk (now Upwork). During this time I also
took a lot of CS classes at community college. I'm pretty sure that I
earned [CSM's Computer Science Applications and Development Associate
in Science degree][degree] but I never got a diploma from them.
I did the contracts and classes for a year and then got my first
full-time job at Arrayent, an internet of things platform. I wrote docs for
their web service API, embedded libraries, and web apps. I worked at Arrayent
for 3 years and then went to work for Google's Web DevRel team. I wrote
[Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools) and
[Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview)
docs for 4 years, and then I was a people manager and the content lead 
for [web.dev](https://web.dev) for 2 years. After 6 years at Google I
quit and took a [sabbatical](/essays/sabbatical) for 9 months.
Then I re-joined Google in May 2022 to work on [Fuchsia](https://fuchsia.dev).
I'm now focused on hardware and low-level software documentation as a
staff-level individual contributor.
