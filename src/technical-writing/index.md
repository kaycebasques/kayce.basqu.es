## Career summary

[degree]: http://catalog.collegeofsanmateo.edu/current/programs/computer-science-applications-and-development-as.php

I studied history at UC Berkeley. After graduating I struggled to land
a job and had to face the uncomfortable truth that I didn't have enough
marketable skills. I also didn't know what I wanted to do. One day while
reading the Economist I learned about an online marketplace for all types of
computer work. I did that for a year and eventually realized that technical
writing was a good fit for me. During this time I also took a lot of CS
classes at community college. I'm pretty sure that I earned an
[Computer Science Applications and Development Associate's degree][degree].
I did the contracts and classes for a year and then got my first
full-time job at Arrayent, an internet of things platform. I wrote docs for
their web service API, embedded libraries, and web apps. I worked at Arrayent
for 3 years and then went to work for Google's Web DevRel team. I wrote
[Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools) and
[Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview)
docs for 4 years, and then I was a people manager and the content lead 
for [web.dev](https://web.dev) for 2 years. After 6 years at Google I quit
and took a [sabbatical](/essays/sabbatical) for 9 months. Then I re-joined
Google in May 2022 to work on [Fuchsia](https://fuchsia.dev). I'm now focused
on hardware and low-level software documentation as a staff-level individual
contributor.
