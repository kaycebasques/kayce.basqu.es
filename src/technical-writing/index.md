My trade is technical writing.

A brief summary of my career: I studied history at UC Berkeley.
I got my initial technical writing experience taking contracts
on oDesk (now Upwork). I did that for about a year and then got
a full-time job at Arrayent, an internet of things platform.
I wrote docs for their web service API, embedded libraries, and web
apps. I did that for about 3 years and then went to Google to work
for their web developer relations team. I wrote a lot of the docs for
[Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools) and
[Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview),
and then I was a people manager and the content lead for
[web.dev](https://web.dev) for 2 years. I quit Google and took
a [sabbatical](/essays/sabbatical) for 9 months and then re-joined
Google to work on [Fuchsia](https://fuchsia.dev). I'm now focused
on hardware and low-level software documentation.
