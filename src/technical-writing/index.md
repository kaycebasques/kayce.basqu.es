# {{title}}

I am a professional technical writer. By "professional" I just
mean that I have somehow convinced people to pay me to do it for
going on 10 years now.

## Career summary

I studied history at UC Berkeley. I got my initial technical writing
experience taking contracts on oDesk (now Upwork). During this time I also
took a lot of CS classes at community college. I did that for about a year
and then got a full-time job at Arrayent, an internet of things platform.
I wrote docs for their web service API, embedded libraries, and web
apps. I did that for about 3 years and then went to Google to work
for their web developer relations team. I wrote a lot of the
[Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools) and
[Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview)
docs for about 4 years, and then I was a people manager and the
content lead for [web.dev](https://web.dev) for 2 years. I quit
Google and took a [sabbatical](/essays/sabbatical) for 9 months.
Then I re-joined Google to work on [Fuchsia](https://fuchsia.dev).
I'm now focused on hardware and low-level software documentation.
