Hello! I'm Kayce. Welcome to my website. I live in San Francisco. I'm married
to [Gabi](https://instagram.com/gabjoart). We have a little dog named
[Cheese](/img/cheebo.jpg).

## Work

My career is technical writing. My higher calling in this work is to share
knowledge effectively and to help others do the same. I've been doing it for
more than 10 years now. I currently work on [Pigweed](https://pigweed.dev).
