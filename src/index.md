Howdy! I'm Kayce. Welcome to my little homestead on the good ol' World Wide Web.
For the last 6 years I have worked as a technical writer at Google. Currently
(May 2021) I am preparing to take a 1-year sabbatical (June 2021 to June 2022).
Check out the [2021 Sabbatical](/sabbatical/) part of my website if you'd
like to read more about what I'm up to.
