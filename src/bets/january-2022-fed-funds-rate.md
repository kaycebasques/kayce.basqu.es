## Updates

<h3 id="2021-december-31">2021 December 31</h3>

* 0% chance the rate will be lower
* 97% chance the rate will be the same
* 3% chance the rate will be higher

The GJ Open crowd forecast is 95% "same" and 5% "higher", which
was the same as my last forecast. I am attempting to game my GJ Open
Brier Score by pushing my forecast slightly beyond the crowd consensus.

<h3 id="2021-december-23">2021 December 23</h3>

* 0% chance the rate will be lower
* 95% chance the rate will be the same
* 5% chance the rate will be higher

The [CME tool][cme] now has the odds at 5%. The current crowd forecast
on GJ Open is 92% same rate. That's way too low.

<h3 id="2021-november-3">2021 November 3</h3>

* 0% chance the rate will be lower
* 98% chance the rate will be the same
* 2% chance the rate will be higher

The [CME tool][cme] now has the odds at 2.5%.

The last time that the Fed raised rates was December 2015.
In the meeting before that, [October 2015][oct2015], the Fed
mentioned that they were thinking about raising rates in the next
meeting. They did not make any mention like that this time.

* 0% chance the rate will be lower
* 93% chance the rate will be the same
* 7% chance the rate will be higher

Jim Bianco put out a [thread](https://twitter.com/biancoresearch/status/1452808415894556679)
with some links to tools that supposedly show how the market is
pricing in hikes. The [CME tool][cme]
puts the odds at 7%. I'm updating my forecast accordingly to account
for the small possibility.

<h3 id="2021-september-30">2021 September 30</h3>

* 0% chance the rate will be lower
* 100% chance the rate will be same
* 0% chance the rate will be higher

The Fed moves slowly and broadcasts its moves well in advance. Their
"transitory inflation" narrative is not facing a unified attack. We
would need to see a severe shock or months of sustained inflation
across many, many politically sensitive areas in order for the Fed
to move higher. They also will not move lower because negative rates
for the world's reserve currency would be a very controversial move
that could cause a lot of disorder in markets. Barring a severe shock
(e.g. February 2020) if the Fed was going to move higher or lower,
they would have made it very clear by now.
