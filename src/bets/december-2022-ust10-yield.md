## Updates

<h3 id="20211223">2022 December 23</h3>

* Lower than 0%: 1%
* Between 0% and 1%, inclusive: 30%
* Higher than 1% but lower than 2%: 50%
* Between 2% and 3%, inclusive: 12%
* Higher than 3% but lower than 4%: 5%
* 4% or higher: 2%

Today the rate is 149 BPS. We are equal distance from 100 BPS and 200 BPS.
The most likely scenario to me is 2022 being relatively boring and therefore
the 10-year yield floating between 100-200 BPS. Lower than 0% is not impossible
but highly, highly unlikey. Having a growth scare and dropping between 0-100 BPS
seems slightly more likely to me. Moves to 200 BPS and higher are possible though
given all the talk about inflation.

<h3 id="20211207">2022 December 7</h3>

Today the rate is at 146 BPS.

According to [CME], the market is forecasting the following probabilities
for the Fed Funds Rate (in BPS) on 2022 December 14:

* 0-25: 2%
* 25-50: 10%
* 50-75: 24%
* 75-100: 29%
* 100-125: 21%
* 125-150: 9%
* 150-175: 2%

Assuming that the 10-year yield rises along with the Fed Funds Rate,
we can map these probabilities to 10-year yields:

* 0-25: 146-171
* 25-50: 171-196
* 50-75: 196-221
* 75-100: 221-246
* 100-125: 246-271
* 125-150: 271-296
* 150-175: 296-321

Mapping this to the GJO answers:

* Lower than 0%: 0%
* Between 0% and 1%, inclusive: 0%
* Higher than 1% but lower than 2%: 12%
* Between 2% and 3%, inclusive: 83%
* Higher than 3% but lower than 4%: 2%
* 4% or higher: 0%

However, I think the market is underpricing the odds of a deflationary panic.
We saw the 10-year yield fall to 60 BPS during the pandemic panic. And the long-term
trend is lower yields. I do however agree that yields higher than 3% are
unlikely because there's too much debt in the system to handle rates that
high. So I will bet against the market a bit here and increase the odds of
lower rates a bit. And it's not *impossible* for rates to be lower than 0%
or higher than 3% so I'll assign very small probabilities to those events.

* Lower than 0%: 1%
* Between 0% and 1%, inclusive: 9%
* Higher than 1% but lower than 2%: 23%
* Between 2% and 3%, inclusive: 64%
* Higher than 3% but lower than 4%: 2%
* 4% or higher: 1%
