## Updates

<h3 id="20211207">2022 December 7</h3>

Today the rate is at 146 BPS.

According to [CME], the market is forecasting the following probabilities
for the Fed Funds Rate (in BPS) on 2022 December 14:

* 0-25: 2%
* 25-50: 10%
* 50-75: 24%
* 75-100: 29%
* 100-125: 21%
* 125-150: 9%
* 150-175: 2%

Assuming that the 10-year yield rises along with the Fed Funds Rate,
we can map these probabilities to 10-year yields:

* 0-25: 146-171
* 25-50: 171-196
* 50-75: 196-221
* 75-100: 221-246
* 100-125: 246-271
* 125-150: 271-296
* 150-175: 296-321

Mapping this to the GJO answers:

* Lower than 0%: 0%
* Between 0% and 1%, inclusive: 0%
* Higher than 1% but lower than 2%: 12%
* Between 2% and 3%, inclusive: 83%
* Higher than 3% but lower than 4%: 2%
* 4% or higher: 0%

However, I think the market is underpricing the odds of a deflationary panic.
We saw the 10-year yield fall to 60 BPS during the pandemic panic. And the long-term
trend is lower yields. I do however agree that yields higher than 3% are
unlikely because there's too much debt in the system to handle rates that
high. So I will bet against the market a bit here and increase the odds of
lower rates a bit. And it's not *impossible* for rates to be lower than 0%
or higher than 3% so I'll assign very small probabilities to those events.

* Lower than 0%: 1%
* Between 0% and 1%, inclusive: 9%
* Higher than 1% but lower than 2%: 23%
* Between 2% and 3%, inclusive: 64%
* Higher than 3% but lower than 4%: 2%
* 4% or higher: 1%
