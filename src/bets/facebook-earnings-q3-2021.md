## Rationale

News coverage of Facebook is overwhelmingly negative at the moment.
Some bad news happened on Thursday (2021 October 22) causing the share
price to drop from above $340 to below $325. Yet the company continues to be
very profitable. The things that are being discussed in the news have
not yet affected Facebook's profitability.

## Actions

* On 2021 October 25 (before market open) I bought 3 shares at $324.20
  per share.
* On 2021 October 25 (after market close) I sold 3 shares at $332.33
  per share.

## Results

* Approximately 2.5% of profit per share.
* Approximately $24.39 of total profit.
