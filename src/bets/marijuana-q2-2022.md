## Background

[market]: https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/7363

PredictIt has a [betting market][market] for the following question:

> Will marijuana be rescheduled under the Controlled Substances Act by April 20?

The market resolves to `Yes` in the event that marijuana is removed
from the Schedule I list before 21 April 2022.

## Updates

<h3 id="2021-november-29">2021 November 29</h3>

I placed a $50 `Yes` bet on PredictIt at $0.10 per share.

I don't believe this event will actually happen per se.
Rather, I think the market has mispriced the odds. It's
currently at 10% whereas overall I think the chance of this happening
is somewhere between 25% and 50%.

At minimum, I think the share price will at least rise before the end
date. Representative Mace (R-SC) introduced a [cannabis reform bill][bill]
2 weeks ago. The bill should at least get some media attention. The main
unknown is whether Congress will debate the bill before 21 April 2022.
