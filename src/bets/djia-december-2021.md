## Background

[GJ Open asks](https://www.gjopen.com/questions/2150):

> What will be the closing value of the Dow Jones
> Industrial Average on 31 December 2021?

The possible answers are:

* Lower than 33,000.00
* Between 33,000.00 and 34,000.00, inclusive
* Higher than 34,000.00 but lower than 35,000.00
* Between 35,000.00 and 36,000.00, inclusive
* Higher than 36,000.00 but lower than 37,000.00
* 37,000.00 or more

[CNBC's data](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DJI) will determine
the outcome.

## Updates

<h3 id="20211223">2021 December 23</h3>

* Lower than 33000: 0%
* Between 33000 and 34000, inclusive: 0%
* Higher than 34000 but lower than 35000: 0%
* Between 35000 and 36000, inclusive: 25%
* Higher than 36000 but lower than 37000: 75%
* 37000 or more: 0%

I think it's much more likely that we end the year in an uptrend rather than a downtrend.

<h3 id="20211207">2021 December 7</h3>

* Lower than 33000: 1%
* Between 33000 and 34000, inclusive: 3%
* Higher than 34000 but lower than 35000: 5%
* Between 35000 and 36000, inclusive: 11%
* Higher than 36000 but lower than 37000: 60%
* 37000 or more: 20%

The recent volatility/downturn reduces the odds of +37K. Other than
that I still think the index is trending up.

My DIA trade hit its trailing stop target and sold automatically. My P&L
shows a 3% loss. So I guess I set the trailing stop at 3%?

<h3 id="2021-october-26">2021 October 26</h3>

* Lower than 33000: 1%
* Between 33000 and 34000, inclusive: 3%
* Higher than 34000 but lower than 35000: 5%
* Between 35000 and 36000, inclusive: 11%
* Higher than 36000 but lower than 37000: 40%
* 37000 or more: 40%

I'm updating my forecast to acknowledge declines are always
possible. There's still an upward tilt. The odds of a small
move up and a big move up seem equal.

I also put on a trade on DIA. I bought 3 shares at $357.86
per share. I also set a trailing stop order at 5%. And a reminder
to sell on 2022 January 3.

I also tried my hand at an expected value calculation. I wasn't
sure how to calculate values for ranges so I just used the midpoint.

* 33000 * 0.01 = 330
* 33500 * 0.03 = 1005
* 34500 * 0.05 = 1725
* 35500 * 0.11 = 3905
* 36500 * 0.40 = 14600
* 37000 * 0.40 = 14800

Current expected ending value for DJIA is therefore around 36365,
or ~1.6% of profit on the DIA trade.

This [seasonal chart][seasonal]
suggests that DJIA has a tailwind from October to December. The data was only from
the 2000s, though. This [longer-term seasonal chart][seasonal2] however suggests that
the DJIA will be flat.

My naive technical analysis is that the stock market has taken a breather since
July 2021. No strong movement higher or lower. We're more likely to have another
move up rather than down.

There are a few component stocks that might be drags on the DJIA basket. Namely,
Intel, Cisco, and Boeing. But I don't think they'll mess it up enough to drag down the
entire basket.

I did an analysis of the earnings surprises for each of the component stocks
([example](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/aapl/earnings)) over the
last 4 quarters. The weighted average surprise was:

* Q2 2021: 28.79%
* Q1 2021: 26.29%
* Q4 2020: -4.13%
* Q3 2020: 43.80%

Earnings 25% above expectations doesn't sound like big news but it's obviously not
bad news either.
