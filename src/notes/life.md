How did life begin? This page contains my evergreen notes on the topic.

## Etymology of "life"

[*leip-]: https://www.etymonline.com/word/*leip-#etymonline_v_52671

The word seems to come from [*leip-], a Proto-Indo-European root meaning "to
stick, adhere; fat".

## The Hadean

[eon]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_time_scale#Divisions_of_geologic_time

The first [eon] of Earth's history. Life probably started
during the Hadean.

## Prebiotic chemistry

From *Astrobiology: A Very Short Introduction* (page 31):

> There is wide agreement that the origin of life would have been preceded
> by a period of chemical evolution, or *prebiotic chemistry*, during which
> more complex organic molecules were produced from simpler ones... life is
> unlikely to originate today because organisms are continually eating the
> chemical compounds that are needed. On the other hand, before life existed,
> chemical conditions for the origin of life would have been prevalent.
