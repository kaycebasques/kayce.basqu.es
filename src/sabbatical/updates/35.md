## Last week

We finished the second and final week of our honeymoon (a staycation
in San Franciso). We started finishing our final wedding-related
tasks, such as thank you cards. I started getting ready to re-enter the
workforce.

## What's next

Wrapping up the final wedding-related tasks and working towards
re-entering the workforce.
