## Reading

I continued reading [*Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos Or Community?*][mlk].

## Last week

On Friday Gabi and I went to Outside Lands. We walked over 30K steps!
Saturday was Gabi's birthday. We got lunch with friends and recovered from Outside Lands.
On Sunday Gabi and I cruised around San Francisco on a Revel moped and walked
around in our ghost costumes. I don't remember what I did on Monday.
On Tuesday I started working on a few technical writing projects. I have
been trying to focus on landing one project at a time, but in this case
it makes more sense to work on all of them simultaneously. Gabi and I also
went to the Legion of Honor and got some beers with 2 of her close friends.
On Wednesday I continued work on the technical writing projects. I also added
an RSS feed for the Bookworm Club. On Thursday I continued working on my
technical writing projects and went down to Palo Alto to celebrate a friend's
birthday.

## What's next

It's time to start planning our wedding! I'll also continue working
on my technical writing projects.
