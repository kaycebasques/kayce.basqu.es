## Reading

I continued reading [*Energy and Civilization*][energyciv] by
Vaclav Smil.

## Last week

I attempted to start writing my autobiography. It was a flop.
I couldn't create the motivation needed to start a major new
project. I think I need to do more thinking about my methodology
for creating an autobiography as well as what's in/out of scope.
Aside from that I continued doing the classwork for my
Python class.

## What's next

I am going to work on the Bookworm Club until I ship an MVP.
I think I couldn't motivate myself to work deeply on the
autobiography because of the nagging awareness that I haven't
yet finished an MVP for the Bookworm Club. I am trying to break
the habit of starting projects and never finishing them.
