## Reading

I continued reading [*Mycelium Running*][mycelium] by Paul Stamets.

[mycelium]: https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/196974/mycelium-running-by-paul-stamets/

## Last week

The wedding is almost here! This week we're finishing up the last
tasks related to the wedding. In my downtime I'm continuing to learn
about mycology and search for mushrooms in the parks around our home.

## What's next

The wedding and our honeymoon in Tahoe!
