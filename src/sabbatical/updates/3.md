My focus for week 3 was learning Portuguese. My partner is
from Brazil and I've been down here for about 2 months and her
family doesn't speak much English. My main strategy was to
speak Portuguese for the entire week with her. That didn't
work out too well. We simply got lazy and didn't want to
labor through Portuguese in order to communicate routine
things, like what to eat. I also had a book of short stories
designed for beginners. I worked through 6 or 7 of those stories
(out of 21 total) but didn't make as much progress as I had
expected. I think I can make more progress next time by setting
up more specific goals and thinking through all the different
strategies at my disposal (Duolingo, watching Brazilian TV, and
so on). Also, although I don't like schedules, I think they truly
are key for making progress. E.g. setting aside 3 hours every day
for X.

I also finished *Trickster Makes This World*. It got a bit too
philosophical at times but I really loved the ideas about trickster
being a key agent of change for societies. Plus, I simply love
mischief, so tricksters are right up my alley.
Now I'm reading *Liminal Thinking* by Dave Gray.

Next week I will be working on various things related to my
investments and macroeconomics.
