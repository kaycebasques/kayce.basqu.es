## Reading

I read [*Joshua Tree: The Complete Guide*][jt].

## Last week

From Friday to Sunday I was in Joshua Tree with my mom and
brother. On Monday Gabi and I walked up to the peak of Corona
Heights and around the Castro. On Tuesday Gabi and I watched the
Dodgers game at Murio's. I'm not sure what I did on Wednesday.
On Thursday we watched it at Anchor Public Taps.

## What's next

<aside>
  I wrote this post retroactively. This was the first week I forgot
  to publish an update! It seems a bit silly to fill out this
  "what's next" section now.
