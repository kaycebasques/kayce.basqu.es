## Reading

I continued reading [*First Aid Manual*][firstaid].

## Last week

This week I mostly did routine tasks and chores. Gabi and I saw the new
Ghostbusters movie at the Alamo. It was fun to be back in a movie
theater! We also went to the de Young museum. That was amazing. We
bought a membership. I also worked quite a bit on automating research
workflows related to my macroeconomic investing.

## What's next

Wedding planning and Christmas preparations.
