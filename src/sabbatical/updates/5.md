## Grandpa's autobiography

One of the main reasons I took a sabbatical was because
I had projects that I knew were important but I could
never find the time or energy to do. My grandpa's
autobiography is one such project. Back in 2018 I did
a bunch of interviews with my grandpa. He told me stories
of his life. I transcribed the recordings and organized
them chronologically. I got the content up on a bare-bones
website and found some photos. But then my progress stalled.
It's been 2-3 years since we started the project! He's not
going to live forever, I would like to give him a mostly
complete work while he's still on Earth!

I'm happy to say that I made some progress on the autobiography
this week. Specifically, I:

* Found relevant photos from the San Francisco Public
  Library's Historical Photograph Collection to supplement my
  grandpa's stories
* Re-organized the content (consolidating chapters, moving incomplete
  stuff to drafts, etc.)
* Got the tony.basqu.es domain working
* Got automatic Netlify deploys working
* Polished up the site UI and presentation

It's all online, you can check it out at
[tony.basqu.es](https://tony.basqu.es).

I'm a bit frustrated that it's still not done, but I'm sure
my psyche is happy that it's much closer to done now!

## What's next

Next week I have a bunch of chores to get out of the way.
E.g. scheduling a flight back to the United States,
scheduling dentist appointments, adding an RSS feed to this site,
etc. Hopefully they won't take all week. I think it's an
interesting experiment to spend a week specifically focused on chores,
though. Let's see how it goes!
