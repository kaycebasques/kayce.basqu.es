I finished [*Water: A Very Short Introduction*][water] and started
[*The City & The City*][city].

## Last week

I'm working 3 hours every day (7 days a week) on a technical writing contract
until the end of August. I also flew back to San Francisco. I'll be here for
a couple months, at least.

## What's next

I'll be continuing the contract until the end of August. I've got a Python class
starting soon. It's the last class I need to take for my associate's degree
in computer science applications and development. I started that degree years
ago and never finished it. One of my sabbatical goals is to finally be done
with it. I've probably got lots of chores to take care of, also. Such as
getting an FBI background check so that I can establish Brazilian residency.
