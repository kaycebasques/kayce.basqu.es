## Reading

[water]: https://www.veryshortintroductions.com/view/10.1093/actrade/9780198708728.001.0001/actrade-9780198708728

I finished [*Infinite Powers*][calculus] by Steven Strogatz. 
It was excellent. On a 5-star scale, it was a 5.
I started reading [*Water: A Very Short Introduction*][water].

## Last week

I continued building the [Bookworm Club](https://bookworm.club).
I have most of the Goodreads logic finished. I'm about halfway done
with the Open Library logic. In general I think I'm about 70% done with
the MVP. I took some detailed notes on the current status of the project,
so that hopefully I can pick it back up without too much loss of context
in a month.

## What's next

As of Thursday I started the 1-month contract which I mentioned in last week's update.
I agreed to work on it for 3 hours every day until 1 September 2021. It was
pretty fun to dig into a new product. I like that the project is constrained to a
single month and that the daily workload is manageable. I like that I'm making
connections in the startup world and helping some other people increase their
odds of success. And it's comforting to replenish my money reserves.
