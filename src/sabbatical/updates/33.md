## Reading

I continued reading [*Mycelium Running*][mycelium] by
Paul Stamets.

[mycelium]: https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/196974/mycelium-running-by-paul-stamets/

## Last week

Friday was a chore day. On Saturday I had my bachelor party.
I vaguely remember it being excellent. Sunday was a spa day
with my bride-to-be. On Tuesday I got married!
On Wednesday we finalized making the marriage legal and got
ready to go to Tahoe. On Thursday we visited Big Trees
State Park in Calaveras County and then drove to Tahoe. On
Friday we finally relaxed a bit in Tahoe!

## What's next

Relaxing in Tahoe, visiting family in Lodi, attending a mushroom
foraging class, and returning to San Francisco.
