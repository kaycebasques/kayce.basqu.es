## Reading

I continued reading [*Energy and Civilization*][energyciv] by
Vaclav Smil.

## Last week

I resumed development of the Bookworm Club. I realized that
the initial website architecture I came up with was just too
weird so I switched it back to a more traditional setup. I was
hesitant to do that because it's yet another delay to shipping
something, but it felt necessary if I'm really going to work on
this project long-term.

My partner is returning to the US from Brazil! I had various
chores around preparing for her return (getting the keys to
our new sublet, packing clothes, and so on). 

The Python class continues. I completed the 3rd partner lab.

## What's next

I don't expect to get much work done next week. I haven't
seen my partner in over a month so we'll probably just want
to enjoy each other's company, explore San Francisco, and
tidy up our new temporary home.
