## Reading

I finished [*Geopolitical Alpha*][alpha] and started
[*First Aid Manual*][firstaid]. In the spirit of branching
out I tried reading a poetry book, but it really wasn't doing
anything for me.

## Last week

From Friday to Sunday I was in Tahoe, celebrating my brother's birthday.
On Monday I worked on wedding planning and the final project for my
Python class. We found out that one of Gabi's close friends in Brazil
died unexpectedly. We're in shock and grieving about that. On Tuesday I
updated some of my [bets](/bets/) and did more wedding planning. On Wednesday
and Thursday I did homework for my Python class and did more wedding
planning.

## What's next

Wedding planning!
