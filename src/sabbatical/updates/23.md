## Last week

On Friday and Saturday I went into a rabbit hole writing a Python script
that helps me identify long volatilty trades. On Sunday Gabi and I watched
Dune (the new movie) with a couple friends. It was amazing! Gabi and I are
now reading the book together. We'll probably see the movie in theaters
again. On Monday I reflected on Dune and secured a date for our wedding
ceremony. On Tuesday I worked on one of my technical writing projects.
I'll call it the template project. I am making a template website that
is optimized for technical documentation. I will be using this template
website as the starting point for future projects. On Wednesday and Thursday
I continued working on the template project and started another technical
writing project, which I'll call the guide project. On Thursday night
Gabi and I went out with a few of my friends.

## What's next

I will continue working on the template and guide projects and kick
our wedding planning into high gear.
