## Reading

I finished reading [*First Aid Manual*][firstaid] and also finished
reading [*Entangled Life*][fungi].

## Last week

On Friday Gabi and I got the ingredients for guacamole, made
said guacamole, and spent Christmas Eve at my mom's home with
my family. On Saturday we lounged around some more at my mom's.
On Sunday we started dogsitting a dog named Cheese for a week.
It was a bit stressful at first but we're enjoying it now. 
On Monday night I decided to try a 24-hour fast. I didn't quite
make it to 24 hours. It was more like 20 hours. Nonetheless it
was an interesting experience! Throughout the week I continued
learning Flutter development and continued setting up the wedding.
*Entangled Life* has encouraged me to walk around Golden Gate Park
and look for mushrooms. I did that a few times this week.

## What's next

Wedding planning! I am going to try out being more rigorous with
scheduling. I.e. 1 hour for exercise, 1 for programming, etc.
