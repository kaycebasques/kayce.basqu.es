## Reading

I finished [*A Matter Of Degrees*][degrees] by Gino Segre and
started [*Energy and Civilization*][energyciv] by Vaclav Smil.

## Last week

I am writing to you from a Raspberry Pi! It's pretty great. Check out my
[Ode to Raspberry Pi (and Arduino)](/blog/ode-to-raspberry-pi) post.
I worked through almost all of the interactive textbook for my Python class.
It was boring and tedious but worthwhile because I think I have a pretty solid
grasp of the language now, and it's one of those languages I've been meaning
to learn.

## What's next

I've got my yearly camping trip with my brother and friends next week, Monday
to Thursday. This year marks 10 consecutive years! I'm just going to focus
the next couple of days around getting ready for that.
