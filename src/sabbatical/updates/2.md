This week I finished laying the foundation for chronicling
my sabbatical. I [finished some big updates for my website][PR],
published the [sabbatical prologue](/sabbatical/prologue),
decided to do weekly updates, and subsequently published
[an update for week 1](/sabbatical/updates/1/) retroactively,
as well as the update you're reading right now of course.
I continued reading *Trickster Makes This World*. We're still
in [Jeriocoacoara](/sabbatical/updates/1#jericoacoara);
we have 1 more week here.

I am starting to settle into the groove of a sabbatical
schedule. My day usually looks like this:

* Wake up and make coffee
* Read
* Work on personal projects once the caffeine high hits
* Do some "daily habit" work (e.g. meditate, exercise)
* Do routine and common human stuff (e.g. cooking or laundry)
* Work a bit more on personal projects and daily habits
* Routine and common human stuff
* Rest at night (e.g. Gabi and I are currently enjoying RuPaul's Drag Race
  and nature documentaries)

Next week I am going to focus on studying Portuguese. I am
currently in Brazil and Gabi is from here.
