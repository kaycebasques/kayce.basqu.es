## Reading

I continued reading [*Energy and Civilization*][energyciv] by
Vaclav Smil. It's a long, dense read and will probably take a
while to finish.

## Last week

Last week we had Puma Prowl X! Puma Prowl is the yearly camping
trip that I go on with my brother and our mutual friends. We have
done it for 10 years straight. I spent most of Saturday and Sunday
preparing for it. The actual camping was Monday through Thursday.

    When was the last time you woke up in a hammock to a swig
    of whiskey?

## What's next

This week I am going to work on my autobiography. I have no
intentions of publicly publishing it. I mainly just want to
remember interesting stories and events from my life and use
the autobiography as a tool for discovering new insights about
life. I'll also need to do some homework for the Python class.
