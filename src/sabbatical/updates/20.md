## Last week

On Friday Gabi and I rented a [Revel moped](https://gorevel.com/mopeds/moped)
and took a fun tour around San Francisco. On Saturday our close friends
showed us how to cook with a donabe. On Sunday Gabi and I traveled down the
Peninsula to visit my grandpa, grandma-in-law, and mom. On Tuesday Gabi and I
explored Japantown. On Thursday Gabi and I went to SFMOMA. Throughout the week
I got the Bookworm Club close to a [minimum viable product][mvp].
