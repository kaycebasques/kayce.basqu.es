## Reading

[deficit]: https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/stephanie-kelton/the-deficit-myth/9781541736184/
[calculus]: http://www.stevenstrogatz.com/books/infinite-powers

I finished [*The Deficit Myth*][deficit]. On to [*Infinite Powers*][calculus]
by Steven Strogatz. It's a wonderful pop-sci book about the history and
applications of calculus. Learning math(s) was another one of those things
that I've been wanting to do for a long time but could never find the time
or energy for. This book could be the initial inspiration that I needed
to start the journey.

## Last week

Last week I started building the [Bookworm Club](https://bookworm.club).
The gist of the website/app is to make it easier for readers to find
other people all over the world who are reading the same book, so that
they can discuss it together. I'm also creating a blog on that site
where I'll discuss interesting ideas from books that I've read.

## What's next

I'm going to continue working on the Bookworm Club.
