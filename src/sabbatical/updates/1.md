## Jericoaocoara

On 3 June 2021 (the day before the official start of my sabbatical)
I traveled with my partner and her family to a tropical paradise
in Brazil called Jericoacoara. It's very famous within
Brazil but doesn't seem that well known outside of Brazil
(I had never heard of it, at least). So on 4 June 2021 (the official
start date) I woke up settled into this new, beautiful environment.
I really like how we timed that.

To get to Jeri you need to [travel along the beach](https://youtu.be/P9pVofAfvKU)
and through sand dunes. One thing I didn't know about driving through
sand is that it helps to deflate your tires so you don't sink into the sand.
I believe we dropped the pressure to 15 PSI.

The whole "village" is covered in sand. There are no concrete roads.
The only vehicles you see are ATVs, dune buggies, and 4WD trucks.
I put "village" in quotes because although that's what they call it,
the reality is Jeri is a big tourist spot with probably 10-20K people
(including the locals).

Like most of Brazil, there are stray dogs everywhere:

Here's the view from our deck:

We go out and watch the sunset most days:

## Projects

As mentioned in my [sabbatical prologue](/sabbatical/prologue) I plan
on focusing on one project per week. I didn't get off to a great start
in that regard because I actually started 2 things:

[PR]: https://github.com/kaycebasques/kayce.basqu.es/pull/99

1. Reading [*Trickster Makes This World*](http://www.lewishyde.com/publications/trickster) by Lewis Hyde.
1. [Refreshing my website and creating the sabbatical prologue][PR]
   blog post.

Because I enjoy reading so much I'm thinking that perhaps I won't consider
it one of my "projects". Instead, I might consider it a daily habit.

Speaking of habits, I found a habit tracking app that pretty much provides
everything I want and nothing I don't: [Strides](https://www.stridesapp.com/).

Although it wasn't the best start, I had also consciously decided to take
it easy since this was my birthday week and since taking a sabbatical
is a big life change and should be celebrated a bit.
