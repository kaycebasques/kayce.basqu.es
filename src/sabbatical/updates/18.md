## Reading

I finally finished [*Energy and Civilization*][energyciv] by
Vaclav Smil. Lots of interesting ideas, but a long read! I'm
not sure what I'll read next.

## Last week

My partner flew in on Friday. We haven't seen each other for
over a month so we spent Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday
enjoying each other's company and getting her settled in SF. We
are subleasing a furnished place that overlooks the Panhandle.
We did deep cleaning and tidying on Saturday. On Sunday we went
to the last regular season San Francisco Giants game. It was a
historic game (the Giants finally clinched their division and
broke the franchise record for most regular season wins) and it
was my partner's first time seeing the ballpark so that was a
special experience. I can't remember what we did on Monday and
Tuesday. Aside from some chores I think we walked around Golden
Gate Park a bit and enjoyed the neighborhood around Haight &
Ashbury. On Wednesday I drove with my brother and mom to Joshua
Tree. We rented an Airbnb for her birthday and will be here until
Sunday. I didn't do any work on Bookworm Club. I completed
a quiz for the Python class.

## What's next

I'll keep working on the Bookworm Club.
