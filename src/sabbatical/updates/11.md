## Reading

[city]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_%26_the_City

I continued [*The City & The City*][city]. It's an interesting premise
but I'm not feeling emotionally invested in the characters.

## Last week

I continued the technical writing contract and started the Python class
which I mentioned last week.

## What's next

I'll be continuing the contract and the Python class.
