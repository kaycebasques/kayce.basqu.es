## Reading

I started reading [*Mycelium Running*][mycelium] by Paul Stamets.

## Last week

Friday was New Year's Eve. Gabi and I took a long walk through Golden
Gate Park with the dog we're watching. We made tacos and celebrated the new
year at home. Saturday I continued learning Flutter development. Throughout
the week I went into a rabbit hole learning about mycology. I walked through
Golden Gate Park a lot looking for mushrooms. I uploaded a lot of observations
to iNaturalist. I read a lot of articles and watched a lot of videos about
mycology. And of course I continued random tasks related to the wedding.

## What's next

It's the last week before the wedding. That will probably take up
most of my time.
