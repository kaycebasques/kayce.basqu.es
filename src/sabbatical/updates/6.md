## Reading

[deficit]: https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/stephanie-kelton/the-deficit-myth/9781541736184/

This week I read [*The Deficit Myth*][deficit]. I'm not finished yet. It's thought-provoking!
Chapter 7 is rather bleak, though. I don't know what I'll read next.

## Last week

Last week I focused on various chores/tasks related to my medium/long-term
life plans. It was pretty boring and sometimes frustrating, but looking back, I did
indeed appear to make decent progress (or at least get more clarity)
on lots of this stuff that I would eventually have had to do anyways.

## What's next

I've been kicking around a business/app idea related to reading
for a few years now, and this week I'm going to start hacking
on it!
