## Last week

On Friday Gabi and I went to Club Deluxe with her classmates.
On Saturday I went into a rabbit hole building a script that gathers
and analyzes the recent earnings surprises for each member of the
Dow Jones Industrial Average. On Friday and Saturday I also completed the
midterm quiz and assignment for my Python class. On Sunday we had an atmospheric
river pass over San Francisco. I put on my rain gear and walked through
Golden Gate Park a bit (watching out for widowmakers, of course). On Monday I
worked out the DNS kinks for the Bookworm Club and built a fun feature
on the sign up page. The placeholder for the email cycles through
fictional email addresses for popular literary characters. I also
built out the <a href="/bets/">Bets</a> section of this website.
