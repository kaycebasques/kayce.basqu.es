## Last week

On Friday Gabi and I went to Club Deluxe with her classmates.
On Saturday I went into a rabbit hole building a script that gathers
and analyzes the recent earnings surprises for each member of the
Dow Jones Industrial Average. On Friday and Saturday I also completed the
midterm quiz and assignment for my Python class. On Sunday we had an atmospheric
river pass over San Francisco. I put on my rain gear and walked through
Golden Gate Park a bit (watching out for widowmakers, of course). On Monday I
worked out the DNS kinks for the Bookworm Club and built a fun feature
on the sign up page. The placeholder for the email cycles through
fictional email addresses for popular literary characters. I also
built out the [Bets](/bets) section of this website. On
Tuesday I wrote the [Resulting](https://bookworm.club/blog/resulting)
post on Bookworm Club. On Wednesday I battle-hardened Bookworm Club
a bit and enjoyed the Upper Haight neighborhood with Gabi. On Thursday
I did some preparation for Outside Lands and started working on one of
my technical writing projects.

## What's next

On Friday Gabi and I are going to Outside Lands. Saturday is Gabi's
birthday. Sunday is Halloween. I doubt I'll work much those days.
After that I'm going to work on a couple technical writing projects
I've been kicking around.
