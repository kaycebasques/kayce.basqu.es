## Last week

[sexed]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Education_(TV_series)

From Friday to Monday Gabi and I dogsat/housesat for my cousin in Burlingame.
We binge-watched [*Reservation Dogs*][resdogs] and [*Sex Education*][sexed],
cooked a few meals, and took the dogs on some pleasant walks around
the neighborhood. On Tuesday I did some wedding planning. I am interested
in markets again and it's hard to pull away from *Geopolitical Alpha* and
*The Market Huddle*. On Wednesday and Thursday I did more wedding planning
and reviewed/updated my investment portfolio.

## What's next

I'll be in Tahoe from Friday to Sunday, celebrating my brother's
birthday. I'll continue wedding planning.
