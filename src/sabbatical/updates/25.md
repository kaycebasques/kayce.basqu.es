## Reading

I continued [*The Maya*][maya]. My general impression of the book is
that it's a major slog. My main issue is that the authors focus too
much on the research methodology behind everything we know about the Maya.
The lesson learned for me here (if I ever write my own book) is to use
traditional narrative/storytelling techniques and explain research methodology
with footnotes or an appendix.

## Last week

On Friday I did chores (e.g. going to the bank) and routine tasks (e.g.
exercising). I have been listening to 2 podcasts: *Uptime Wind Energy
Podcast* and *The Market Huddle*. On Saturday we had a family photo.
A lot of people showed up and it was wonderful seeing everyone again.
On Sunday Gabi and I made a caesar salad (homemade vegan dressing of course)
and went to a Friendsgiving. On Monday I listened to the Marko Papic
episode of the *The Market Huddle*. It was full of so many "aha!" moments.
We secured our wedding ceremony venue. I emailed the first users of the
Bookworm Club about the project's near-term future. On Wednesday Gabi and I
explored San Francisco Botanical Garden. Thursday was Thanksgiving.

## What's next

I will continue planning the wedding and resume work on the Bookworm
Club.
