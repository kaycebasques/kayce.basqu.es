## Reading

I finished [*The City & The City*][city]. It was resoundingly *meh*. 
I started reading [*A Matter Of Degrees*][degrees] by Gino Segre.

## Last week

I continued the technical writing contract and the Python class.

## What's next

I've got a few days left on the technical writing contract.
I'll be continuing the Python class for the next few months.
On a personal note, my partner's student visa got approved, which gives
us clarity about our medium-term plans. At minimum I now need to book a flight
for her and figure out a place to us to live for the next few months. I've
started to clear out the stuff I left in my mom's storage. In that storage
I have a bunch of journals from the last 5-10 years. I might read through
them and start writing my autobiography.

## Contemplation

This is a reminder to myself that next week will mark 3 months of sabbatical!
I should do some introspection on how it's going.
