## Reading

I continued reading [*First Aid Manual*][firstaid]. I also started
[*Entangled Life*][fungi].

## Last week

This week I continued routine tasks, like Christmas shopping.
I continued working on my Python scripts that automate some
of my research workflows for macroeconomic investing. I started
exercising again. I picked up a small journal for doodling.

## What's next

I don't know! More wedding planning, probably. Gabi and I
will probably spend most of Friday (Christmas Eve) and Saturday
with my family.
