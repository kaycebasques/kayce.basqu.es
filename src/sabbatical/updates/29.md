## Last week

This week I continued routine tasks, like Christmas shopping.
I continued working on my Python scripts that automate some
of my research workflows for macroeconomic investing. I started
exercising again. I picked up a small journal for doodling.
I think I got a Flutter development environment successfully set up.
It was a bit of a slog and required gigabytes of storage space but
I didn't have any really frustrating setup problems.
On Thursday Gabi and I went mushroom hunting in Golden Gate Park.
Later I continued learning how to develop apps with Flutter.

## What's next

I don't know! More wedding planning, probably. Gabi and I
will probably spend most of Friday (Christmas Eve) and Saturday
with my family. I'll continue learning Flutter development.
