## Last week

On Friday I spent quite a few hours doing homework for my Python class.
On Saturday Gabi and I took a bus to the ocean and walked home (through
Golden Gate Park). On Sunday Gabi and I rented a Revel moped (again)
and drove through the Presidio. I didn't work on any projects on Saturday
or Sunday. It was rejuvenating to have 2 days dedicated to rest and relaxation.
On Monday I posted my old [Why salt was so important][salt] post to HN
(again) and it ended up making the front page (again). I pitched the
book club service in the comments and got some registrations! That means
the Bookworm Club got its first legitimate/organic users! I'm now debating
whether I should continue work on the Bookworm Club or proceed with my
technical writing projects. On Tuesday I worked on the Technical Writing
Guide project. On Wednesday and Thursday I resumed wedding planning. On
Thursday night Gabi and I checked out some wedding rings and then went
to the Exploratorium. It was her first time at the Exploratorium
and she loved it! We also had a lovely moped ride from the Exploratorium
back to our home in the Panhandle.

## What's next

I need to go deep into wedding planning!
