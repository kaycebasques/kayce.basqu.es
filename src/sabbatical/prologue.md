title: Taking a 1-year sabbatical as a 30-something
date: 2021-06-04
summary: >
  For my 32nd birthday I'm leaving Google (after 6 years)
  and experimenting with a 1-year sabbatical. This post
  outlines my motivations, plans, hopes, and fears.

<aside>
  By the way, when I say "sabbatical" I simply mean
  a period of time to pursue my own interests. In some
  professions or parts of the world a sabbatical means
  a paid leave, possibly to work on a single project.
  In my case I have completely exited
  my job and will be living off savings and do not have
  a single large project in mind. The phrase
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_year">gap year</a>
  is also an accurate description of what I'm doing.
</aside>

I'm writing this post for a few reasons:

* Quite a few people have told me that they are considering
  doing something similar so I figured I should share my situation,
  thoughts, and experiences to help others
  decide if a sabbatical is worthwhile for them.
* It'll be interesting to note my thoughts before and after
  the experience. I will post a blog at the end of the sabbatical
  (June 2022) and perhaps one 3 years after (June 2025)
  to reflect on the long-term effects of the experience. You
  can add your email to this
  <a href="https://forms.gle/Sdn8myogji11GtSz5">form</a> if you'd like to
  receive emails when I publish these posts.
* I want to normalize the idea of a regularly recurring gap year
  for adults. In my case I might try to do a sabbatical every 10
  years or so.

I don't have any "analytics" AKA tracking on this site,
so if this post helps you make a decision one way or another,
the only way I will ever know is if you [contact me](/contact)!

I've been thinking about doing a sabbatical for a few years now.
Here are the circumstances that finally led me to go for it.

<!--

Keep?

  To answer myself now,
  it's because that path is easier said than done. I wanted time
  to rest and study. I didn't want to spend my whole life "working" in
  one way or another. Why spend all of my 30s working towards the
  prospect of taking time off from work, when the reality is I can do it now?
  And furthermore, the future is not certain. There's no guarantee
  I will have the time, energy, or even money for that matter, to do this
  in the future.

-->

### Kids

The biggest factor was kids. I plan to start having kids in the
next 5 years at most. If that happens I will have much more need for
steady income, benefits, etc. If I'm ever going to take a sabbatical
it feels like now or never. In other words, from here on out it will
probably keep getting harder and harder to take a sabbatical.

### Time, energy, money: pick 2

I read somewhere that you can summarize the challenges
of each phase of life in terms of a tradeoff between
money, energy, and time. Young people generally have energy and time
but no money. Middle-aged people: money and energy but no time.
Old people: money and time but no energy. Whether or not
this is an accurate description of each phase of life isn't
really important. The key breakthrough for me was to
think about my life in terms of a tradeoff
between these 3 resources.

Let's start with money. Part of me worries that I
am financially screwing myself over by interrupting my
career (more on that later), but the fact is that I currently
have enough money to live off savings for 3 years at minimum,
maybe 10 years at maximum. It's weird for me to talk publicly
about my savings but as mentioned before my goal here is
to help others compare their situation with mine when deciding
whether a sabbatical is appropriate for them.

Next, energy. Although I still have 
have lots of energy, it's nothing compared to the energy
I had as a teenager. In other words
I recognize that it could become a depleted commodity
within 10 or 20 years and I should make the most of it
while I still have it.

That leaves us with time. Time
was by far my scarcest commodity leading up to the sabbatical.
Like many people, I wanted to believe that I could excel
at a full-time job while also pursuing personal interests.
After 3 or 4 years of that delusional thinking, I finally
faced the reality that it's very challenging to
do a full-time job, create personal projects,
maintain relationships, keep up my health, do household chores,
and so on, all at the same time.
Considering that the full-time job took up most of my time,
the solution for creating more time was simple: ditch the job.
However, I'll also mention here that time management is not
one of my strengths. I complete tasks slowly and I frequently
take breaks between tasks and I get distracted easily.

I think of my sabbatical as a conscious decision to draw
down my money reserves in order to replenish my time reserves
and to make the most of my finite energy reserves (or perhaps
to replenish them by focusing on nutrition and exercise more and
giving my body more R&R).

### Money does not equal wealth

</blockquote>

Another big factor for me is the idea that money
does not equal wealth. Money is closely related to wealth, for sure,
but it is not the same thing as wealth. I think of wealth
as anything that increases my ability to survive or thrive in life.
Examples:

* Knowing first aid increases your chances of
  survival in case of emergency.
* Meditation increases your ability to cope with
  pain (in all its forms) and enjoy life.

Money is often a very useful tool for acquiring wealth
but it is not itself wealth. The most common trap of course
(as hinted at in that Billy Joel song) is using up all your time
and energy to acquire money without ever converting that money
into wealth. Another example, if you have a million in the bank,
but you've still got anger issues ("anger is like drinking poision
and expecting the other person to die"), you're not wealthy
in my book. I'm at a point in my life
where it seems most worthwhile to focus on converting some
of my money into wealth.

TODO(kaycebasques): Also mention here or *Identity* that
I'm attempting to weaken money's grip over my psyche.

### Identity

<aside>
  This idea is a bit out there and I worry I'll lose you
  here, but I'll say it anyways in case it helps anyone else.
</aside>

This sabbatical is also somewhat of an exercise in voluntarily
giving up my identity in order to free up my psyche to focus
on other aspects of life that are probably important for overall
well-being which I'm currently neglecting. Let me explain this by way of some
personaly history. When I was a teenager I rollerbladed a lot.
Grinding rails, jumping stairs, stuff like that. I gave it up
after college and focused on my career. On social media I still
follow my old skating friends who have kept at it. I'll spare you
the details but it's safe to say they probably
have much richer friendships and possibly enjoyment
of life than I currently have.
Now that I don't have the fancy career, who am I? 

### Financical independence

Although Google compensated me well, it was not the
kind of compensation that would enable the kind of financial
independence I dream of. I might as well see if I can create
that for myself. I'm under no delusion that it's guaranteed
to happen or even probable. And I'm well aware that sticking it
out at the high-paying Big Tech job is probably the much
more likely path to financial independence. But it's fun to try
striking it out on my own for a bit. Fortune favors the bold.

### Supportive friends & family

My partner, Gabi, was incredibly supportive of my sabbatical dream.
All of the ideas that you see in this post,
I bounced off her first. She understands all of the risks and costs 
of this path for us and still encouraged me to go for it. It's kind of trite,
but I genuinely see now that having or not having a supportive
partner can be the deciding factor in any big decision. On the flip side,
however, if your partner doesn't support a sabbatical, I don't mean
to say that they're a "bad" person. Maybe they're just more in touch
with the reality that a sabbatical is not a wise bet for you at the moment.
But then again, if you're the breadwinner of the family, I do
think you should question whether your inner circle is selfishly
resisting your desire to take a sabbatical because you are their
[meal ticket](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/meal-ticket).

My family was frequently in disbelief about how well Google compensated
and treated me, so I wasn't expecting them to be as supportive of
my decision to leave my cushy job. But once I went through with it
I was pleasantly surprised at how much they respected and supported my decision.

</blockquote>

As mentioned before it took me a few years to finally build up
the courage to actually follow through with the sabbatical idea.
Here are the things that prevented me from doing it sooner.

### Money

Money is the biggest concern for me. As mentioned before,
I am consciously drawing down my money reserves in order to
replenish my time reserves and focus my energy reserves.
But just because I'm doing it consciously doesn't mean
it's easy for me. Here are a few loosely related ideas
around my money fears.

* It's slightly embarrassing to admit, but I really like
  Secrets of the Millionaire Mind by T. Harv Eker. He shared
  a simple strategy in that book that has served me well over
  the last 6 years: regularly track your net worth. Once a month
  or quarter, add up all of your assets and subtract your debts.
  If the number isn't regularly growing, something may be off
  in your overall personal finance strategy. This strategy helped
  me get to the place where I can now afford to take a sabbatical.
  But this strategy also makes me risk-averse.
  For the last 5 years I watched my net worth grew every month,
  and now I'm going to watch it decline month after month.
  I honestly don't know whether my psyche will be able to handle that.
* An implicit bet behind my sabbatical is that Google or the other
  Big Tech companies will take me back. If that turns out to be
  incorrect, then my decision to take a sabbatical will have majorly
  damaged my long-term earnings potential. For the record, I was promoted
  to Staff Technical Writer (L6) right before I left Google. It
  feels weird and humblebragging to mention these details, but again
  the whole point of this post is to help others compare my situation
  with theirs when deciding whether or not to go for a sabbatical.
* I also think that the writing is on the wall that Big Tech will
  eventually get regulated in the next 5 or 10 years, which probably
  means less overall profitability, which therefore means less
  compensation for rank-and-file employees like myself,
  which by extensions implies lower salaries across the software
  industry at large (since Big Tech essentially sets the upper
  bounds of the market rates for rank-and-file salaries).
* Someone close to me lost their job recently.
  I'm no longer in a great position to support them financially.
  If more stuff like that happens, I will regret sabbatical.
* Shortly after resigning, I had a pang of regret about leaving Google.
  Why didn't I keep the job, put hard limits on my time and energy,
  and work towards other goals, like buying a home?

### Career

The fear of getting behind. Behind what? The rat race. Keeping up
with the Joneses. I think of my sabbatical as a bet that I
can re-enter the workforce in a year. Emphasis on bet.
I am very aware that the bet might now pay off.

It was very difficult to do because I had a "good" (use another word)
team, career growth opportunity, great compensations and benefits.
Fear of losing healthcare. As it turns out it seems possible to
get quality healthcare for not obscene amounts of money if you're abroad

How did we get here? Google compensated me well enough that
I am able to live off savings 

### Disappointing myself

A desire to aim bigger. But I struggle with lazyness.
If I don't end up doing much of anything during the sabbatical,
I may regret the experience.

## Plans

I don't pay tribute to the cult of Steve Jobs, but this quote
does give me courage:

When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world, try not to bash into the walls too much, try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money… but that's a very limited life. Life can be much broader. Once you discover one simple fact, and that is everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it. You can influence it. You can build your own things that other people can use. The minute you understand that you can poke life and something will pop out the other side, that you can change it, you can mold it, that's maybe the most important thing… to shakeoff this erroneous notion that life is there and you're just going to live in it versus embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it. I think that's very important and however you learn that, once you learn it, you'll want to change life and make it better because it's kind of messed up in a lot of ways. Once you learn that you'll never be the same again.

As an aside, it's ironic that Jobs is worshipped as a visionary
these days, yet in this very quote he warns against that type
of thinking

Joie de vivre.

Plan to focus on somethign each week

kkkkk

Plans for the future. Try to work at Google again in a year.
Or some other interesting company. 

Converting money into wealth of one kind or another.
Wealth is skills or things that increase your odds of survival
or enjoyment. first aid. piano. 

I'm partially doing this as a way to not be a slave to money.
I have a belief that my net worth should grow every quarter.
It has served me well and I plan on keeping that belief long-term.
psychological rebellion against focusing on money above everything else,
The problem is that the goal post is always moving. I never feel that I have saved enough


At the end of the day, when I think about taking a year for 
a true sabbatical, I'm full of excitement for the possibilities.
And when I think about staying at Google, the only thing that keeps me
there is fear of change, discomfort, or pain. By leaving now I assert 
that I have saved enough money for now. "This Must Be The Place" could 
be a good theme song for this leg of the journey.

Having a supportive partner was hugely helpful, could
not have done it without Gabi's support
