<aside>
  When I say "sabbatical" I simply mean
  a period of time to pursue my own interests. In some
  professions or parts of the world a sabbatical means
  a paid leave, possibly to work on a single project.
  In my case I have completely exited
  my job and will be living off savings and do not have
  a single large project in mind. The phrase
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_year">gap year</a>
  is also an accurate description of what I'm doing.
</aside>

I'm writing this post because quite a few people have told me
that they are considering doing something similar so I figured
I should share my situation, thoughts, and experiences to help others
decide by way of comparison whether or not a sabbatical is right for them.
I will also post annual follow-up posts (June 2022, June 2023, etc.)
to reflect on the long-term effects of the experience. You
can add your email to this <a href="https://forms.gle/Sdn8myogji11GtSz5">form</a>
if you'd like to receive emails when I publish these posts.

If you're also doing or have done a sabbatical and want to swap notes or if
this post helps you make a decision one way or another
please [contact me](/contact)!

## Motivations

<blockquote>

    What do I know, what do I know?<br>
    Wilder than the place we live in<br>
    I'll take you there, I'll take you there<br>
    I don't mind some slight disorder<br>
    Pull up the roots, pull up the roots<br>

I've been thinking about doing a sabbatical for a few years now.
Here are the circumstances that finally led me to go for it.

### Kids

The biggest factor was kids. I plan to start having kids in the
next 5 years at most. If that happens I will have much more need for
steady income, benefits, etc. If I'm ever going to take a sabbatical
it feels like now or never. In other words, from here on out it will
probably keep getting harder and harder to take a sabbatical.

### Time, energy, money: pick 2

I read somewhere that you can summarize the challenges
of each phase of life in terms of a tradeoff between
money, energy, and time. Young people generally have energy and time
but no money. Middle-aged people: money and energy but no time.
Old people: money and time but no energy. Whether or not
this is an accurate description of each phase of life isn't
really important. The key exercise for me was to
think about my life in terms of a tradeoff
between these 3 resources.

Let's start with money. Part of me worries that I
am financially screwing myself over by interrupting my
career (more on that later), but the fact is that I currently
have enough money to live off savings for 3 years at minimum,
maybe 10 years at maximum.

Next, energy. Although I still have 
have lots of energy, it's nothing compared to the energy
I had as a teenager. In other words
I recognize that it could become a depleted commodity
within 10 or 20 years and I should make the most of it
while I still have it.

That leaves us with time. Time
was by far my scarcest commodity leading up to the sabbatical.
Like many people, I wanted to believe that I could excel
at a full-time job while also pursuing personal interests.
After 3 or 4 years of that belief, I finally
faced the reality that it's very challenging to
do a full-time job, create personal projects, continue my education,
maintain relationships, keep up my health, do household chores,
and so on, all at the same time.
Considering that the full-time job took up most of my time,
the solution for creating more time was simple: ditch the job.
However, I'll also mention here that time management is not
one of my strengths. I complete tasks slowly and I frequently
take breaks between tasks and I get distracted easily.

I think of my sabbatical as a conscious decision to draw
down my money reserves in order to replenish my time reserves
and to make the most of my finite energy reserves (or maybe
even replenish my energy reserves by having more time to
focus on nutrition, exercise, etc.).

### Money does not equal wealth

</blockquote>

Another big factor for me is the idea that money
does not equal wealth. Money is closely related to wealth, for sure,
but it is not the same thing as wealth. I think of wealth
as anything that increases my ability to survive or thrive in life.
Examples:

* Knowing first aid increases your chances of
  survival in case of emergency. Having a million in the bank
  won't mean shit if you're on a nature hike 10 miles from
  civilization and you just cut your leg badly and don't know how
  to create a tourniquet.
* Meditation increases your ability to handle pain (in all its forms)
  and enjoy life. If you've got 10 million
  in the bank but you explode in anger when someone cuts you off on the freeway
  ("anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die") you're not
  wealthy in my book.

Money is often a very useful tool for acquiring wealth
but it is not itself wealth. The most common trap of course
(as hinted at in that Billy Joel song) is using up all your time
and energy to acquire money without ever converting that money
into wealth. I'm at a point in my life
where it seems most worthwhile to focus on converting some
of my money into wealth.

Another money-related motivator is that I'm probably too focused on
money generally. This sabbatical is a bit of a psychological
rebellion against focusing on money as the
[be-all end-all](https://writingexplained.org/idiom-dictionary/end-all-be-all)
purpose of my life.

### Identity

This sabbatical is also somewhat of an exercise in voluntarily
giving up my identity in order to free up my psyche to focus
on other aspects of life that are probably important for overall
well-being which I'm currently neglecting.
Now that I don't have the fancy career, who am I? 

### Business & engineering experience

I have a couple of modest business ideas that I plan on pursuing
during my sabbatical.
I don't think they'll make me a millionaire, but they do have
the possibility to create a satisfying little income stream
on the side. Even if they don't, I wager that the overall
business and engineering experience I get from building them
will make me a better technical writer (if I continue that career)
or open up new career paths.

### Supportive friends & family

My partner, Gabi, was incredibly supportive of my sabbatical fantasy.
All of the ideas that you see in this post,
I bounced off her first. She understands all of the risks and costs 
of this path for us and still encouraged me to go for it. It's kind of trite,
but I genuinely see now that having or not having a supportive
partner can be the deciding factor in any big decision like this.

My family was frequently in disbelief about how well Google compensated
and treated me, so I wasn't expecting them to be as supportive of
my decision to leave my cushy job. But once I went through with it
I was pleasantly surprised at how much they respected and supported my decision.

## Fears

</blockquote>

As mentioned before it took me a few years to finally build up
the courage to actually follow through with the sabbatical idea.
Here are the things that prevented me from doing it sooner.

### Money

Money is the biggest concern for me. As mentioned before,
I am consciously drawing down my money reserves in order to
replenish my time reserves and focus my energy reserves.
But just because I'm doing it consciously doesn't mean
it's easy for me. Here are a few loosely related ideas
around my money fears.

* It will be tough to watch my net worth decline month after month,
  after watching it grow pretty much every month over the last 5 years.
  I honestly don't know whether my psyche will be able to handle that.
* Due to compound interest, choosing to draw down my net worth $50K (for example)
  as a 32 year old versus continuing to grow it could have a very large effect
  on my net worth when I'm 65.
* An implicit bet behind my sabbatical is that Google or another quality
  company will hire me again. If that turns out to be
  incorrect, then my decision to take a sabbatical will have majorly
  damaged my long-term earnings potential. For the record, I was promoted
  to Staff Technical Writer (L6) right before I left Google (i.e. I was
  promoted in May 2021 and I left in June 2021) and I have 9 years of experience.
* I also think that the writing is on the wall that Big Tech will
  eventually get regulated in the next 5 or 10 years, which probably
  means less overall profitability, which therefore means less
  compensation for rank-and-file employees like myself,
  which by extension implies lower salaries across the software
  industry at large (since Big Tech essentially sets the upper
  bounds of the market rates for rank-and-file salaries). In other words,
  part of me thinks that there is a finite window of opportunity (5-10 years)
  for earning a high salary in a rank-and-file software job.
* Assuming that I do get a new job with decent compensation again, I won't
  be back at my previous earning power for a while. For example,
  stock grants are a big part of the rank-and-file compensation at Google.
  But those only kick in after a year. So even if I got a comparable job after
  the sabbatical (June 2022), my earnings probably won't recover to my pre-sabbatical
  level (June 2021) until I'm 1 year into the new job (June 2023).
* Someone close to me lost their job recently.
  I'm no longer in a great position to support them financially.
* Shortly after resigning, I had a pang of regret about leaving Google.
  Why didn't I keep the job, put hard limits on my time and energy,
  and work towards other goals, like buying a home?
* Health insurance. It's a mess in the United States, and I was
  worried that I would have to pay [out the wazoo][wazoo] just to get
  barebones coverage.

<aside>
  As luck would have it, global healthcare plans seem reasonably
  priced. My partner and I got covered under Aetna's MHP Exclusive
  plan (their most comprehensive package) for under $300 a month total
  (not $300 per person). We opted for the highest deductible option
  as a bet that we won't need to use the service and because we have the
  savings to cover those deductibles if needed. The catch however is
  that you can only spend up to 6 months in the US.
  This is fine for me because I'm spending most of my sabbatical
  outside of the US.

### Career

As mentioned in the last section, my sabbatical is an implicit
bet that I can put a year-long gap into my career with no major
harm, and that I will be able to easily find a job in a
year. If those assumptions are incorrect, future me might
not be too happy with present me's decisions!

### Lazyness

I have high hopes for all of my sabbatical plans,
but I also know that I struggle with lazyness.
If I don't end up doing much of anything during the
sabbatical, I may feel that it was a mistake to leave
my job, because the job forced me to stay productive
generally throughout life. As they say,
"If you want something done, ask a busy person to do it."

## Plans

I don't have a single big project in mind for my sabbatical.
I have lots of small projects lined up, and I plan on
focusing on one each week. Some will take longer than
a week to finish. I like this approach because it balances
the need to devote time to focus on a single project with
my need for variety. The risk
of course is that I start a bunch of different projects and
don't finish any of them.

Although I don't have a single project, I do have a single overarching theme, however:
[joie de vivre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joie_de_vivre).
Everything that I do, even the mundane stuff (especially the mundane stuff),
I'm going to focus on enjoying it fully.
How you do anything is how you do everything, as the Buddhists say.
I have come to believe that the person who can enjoy whatever
they're doing and make that joy contagious will actually
end up accomplishing the most. Yet even if I don't accomplish anything,
I'll still be joyful, so what would it matter anyways?

At the end of the day, when I think about having a year 
to do whatever the hell I want, I'm full of excitement
for the possibilities and I don't regret it whatsoever yet.
