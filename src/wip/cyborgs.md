SPOILER ALERT! This essay contains A LOT of spoilers about various Star
Wars stories. You can jump to [References](#references) to see exactly
which stories are discussed.

## Overview

The cyborgs of the Star Wars universe have always fascinated me. For one,
they are usually the coolest characters. The word "cyborg" itself is
unexplainably cool. For two, there's a wide spectrum of them. On one end of
the spectrum you have characters who are mostly organic with just a little
bit of machine (Luke). On the other end you've got characters who are mostly
machine with very little of their original organic body remaining (Grievous).
For three, where the character falls on the spectrum seems to correlate with
how much they are aligned with the light side or dark side. Last, it's
worthwhile to contemplate cyborgs in general because it's very much a real
concept in human civilization that many are working towards.

## What is a cyborg?

Per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg):

> A cyborg (/ˈsaɪbɔːrɡ/)—a portmanteau of cybernetic and organism—is
  a being with both organic and biomechatronic body parts.

For me, the key defining feature of a cyborg is someone who started out
organic and added machine parts along the way. Contrast this with something
that started out as a machine and became more organic along the way. That's
not a cyborg. That's something else. I guess you'd call it a robot or android.

## Why become a cyborg?

Most Star Wars cyborgs don't voluntarily become cyborgs to enhance their
powers. They usually do it in response to an injury.
