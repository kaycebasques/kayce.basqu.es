# Sabbatical Update (Week 1)



## Jericoaocoara

On 3 June 2021 (the day before the official start of my sabbatical)
I traveled with my partner and her family to a tropical paradise
in Brazil called Jericoacoara. It's very famous within
Brazil but doesn't seem that well known outside of Brazil
(I had never heard of it, at least). So on 4 June 2021 (the official
start date) I woke up settled into this new, beautiful environment.
I really like how we timed that.

To get to Jeri you need to [travel along the beach](https://youtu.be/P9pVofAfvKU)
and through sand dunes. One thing I didn't know about driving through
sand is that it helps to deflate your tires so you don't sink into the sand.
I believe we dropped the pressure to 15 PSI.

The whole "village" is covered in sand. There are no concrete roads.
The only vehicles you see are ATVs, dune buggies, and 4WD trucks.
I put "village" in quotes because although that's what they call it,
the reality is Jeri is a big tourist spot with probably 10-20K people
(including the locals).

Like most of Brazil, there are stray dogs everywhere:

Here's the view from our deck:

![A photo of the view from our backyard](/media/backyard.jpg)

We go out and watch the sunset most days:

## Projects

As mentioned in my [sabbatical prologue](/sabbatical/prologue) I plan
on focusing on one project per week. I didn't get off to a great start
in that regard because I actually started 2 things:

[PR]: https://github.com/kaycebasques/kayce.basqu.es/pull/99

1. Reading [*Trickster Makes This World*](http://www.lewishyde.com/publications/trickster) by Lewis Hyde.
1. [Refreshing my website and creating the sabbatical prologue][PR]
   blog post.

Because I enjoy reading so much I'm thinking that perhaps I won't consider
it one of my "projects". Instead, I might consider it a daily habit.

Speaking of habits, I found a habit tracking app that pretty much provides
everything I want and nothing I don't: [Strides](https://www.stridesapp.com/).

Although it wasn't the best start, I had also consciously decided to take
it easy since this was my birthday week and since taking a sabbatical
is a big life change and should be celebrated a bit.

  (11 June 2021 to 17 June 2021) Finishing laying the foundation
  for chronicling my sabbatical, and still reading Trickster Makes
  This World.






This week I finished laying the foundation for chronicling
my sabbatical. I [finished some big updates for my website][PR],
published the [sabbatical prologue](/sabbatical/prologue),
decided to do weekly updates, and subsequently published
[an update for week 1](/sabbatical/updates/1/) retroactively,
as well as the update you're reading right now of course.
I continued reading *Trickster Makes This World*. We're still
in [Jeriocoacoara](/sabbatical/updates/1#jericoacoara);
we have 1 more week here.

I am starting to settle into the groove of a sabbatical
schedule. My day usually looks like this:

* Wake up and make coffee
* Read
* Work on personal projects once the caffeine high hits
* Do some "daily habit" work (e.g. meditate, exercise)
* Do routine and common human stuff (e.g. cooking or laundry)
* Work a bit more on personal projects and daily habits
* Routine and common human stuff
* Rest at night (e.g. Gabi and I are currently enjoying RuPaul's Drag Race
  and nature documentaries)

Next week I am going to focus on studying Portuguese. I am
currently in Brazil and Gabi is from here.

[PR]: https://github.com/kaycebasques/kayce.basqu.es/pull/99


# "Sabbatical Update (Week 3)"
date: 2021-06-25
summary: >
  (18 June 2021 to 24 June 2021) Learning Portuguese,
  and finishing Trickster Makes This World.






My focus for week 3 was learning Portuguese. My partner is
from Brazil and I've been down here for about 2 months and her
family doesn't speak much English. My main strategy was to
speak Portuguese for the entire week with her. That didn't
work out too well. We simply got lazy and didn't want to
labor through Portuguese in order to communicate routine
things, like what to eat. I also had a book of short stories
designed for beginners. I worked through 6 or 7 of those stories
(out of 21 total) but didn't make as much progress as I had
expected. I think I can make more progress next time by setting
up more specific goals and thinking through all the different
strategies at my disposal (Duolingo, watching Brazilian TV, and
so on). Also, although I don't like schedules, I think they truly
are key for making progress. E.g. setting aside 3 hours every day
for X.

I also finished *Trickster Makes This World*. It got a bit too
philosophical at times but I really loved the ideas about trickster
being a key agent of change for societies. Plus, I simply love
mischief, so tricksters are right up my alley.
Now I'm reading *Liminal Thinking* by Dave Gray.

Next week I will be working on various things related to my
investments and macroeconomics.

## Reading

[china]: https://global.oup.com/academic/product/modern-china-a-very-short-introduction-9780198753704

I started and finished [*Liminal Thinking*](http://liminalthinking.com/book/)
this week. It's a fast read and has lots of useful nuggets of wisdom!
I'm now reading [*Modern China: A Very Short Introduction*][china].

## Investing

I spent most of this week updating my savings/investment portfolio.
The most interesting thing I did this week was figuring out how
to systematically study the historical correlations between all of
the funds in my portfolio. This systematic study helped me find
some redundancies and reduce the total number of funds in my portfolio,
which will make it easier for me to maintain over the long run. I also
reviewed all of my investing notes over the last year and a half. My
motivation there was to rediscover old ideas that may still be
relevant and understand my own psychology/biases/habits better.
I also started to create a system that backtests the funds I hold
but I seem to have run into a bug with one of the market data APIs
that I rely on. Last, I did some routine maintenance of the portfolio
(buying and selling funds).

## What's next

This week I will be polishing my grandpa's autobiography.
Over the last 5 years I did 10-15 hours of interviews with him,
learning about his life. I then organized those interviews into
their chronological narrative. I have them all up on a website
but the website style and UI is bare-bones. This week I'll be
sprucing up the style/UI and looking for more supplementary
content (such as old images of San Francisco, where my grandpa
grew up).

I finished [*Modern China: A Very Short Introduction*][china].
I'm now reading [*The Deficit Myth*][deficit].

## Grandpa's autobiography

One of the main reasons I took a sabbatical was because
I had projects that I knew were important but I could
never find the time or energy to do. My grandpa's
autobiography is one such project. Back in 2018 I did
a bunch of interviews with my grandpa. He told me stories
of his life. I transcribed the recordings and organized
them chronologically. I got the content up on a bare-bones
website and found some photos. But then my progress stalled.
It's been 2-3 years since we started the project! He's not
going to live forever, I would like to give him a mostly
complete work while he's still on Earth!

I'm happy to say that I made some progress on the autobiography
this week. Specifically, I:

* Found relevant photos from the San Francisco Public
  Library's Historical Photograph Collection to supplement my
  grandpa's stories
* Re-organized the content (consolidating chapters, moving incomplete
  stuff to drafts, etc.)
* Got the tony.basqu.es domain working
* Got automatic Netlify deploys working
* Polished up the site UI and presentation

It's all online, you can check it out at
[tony.basqu.es](https://tony.basqu.es).

I'm a bit frustrated that it's still not done, but I'm sure
my psyche is happy that it's much closer to done now!

## What's next

Next week I have a bunch of chores to get out of the way.
E.g. scheduling a flight back to the United States,
scheduling dentist appointments, adding an RSS feed to this site,
etc. Hopefully they won't take all week. I think it's an
interesting experiment to spend a week specifically focused on chores,
though. Let's see how it goes!

## Reading

[deficit]: https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/stephanie-kelton/the-deficit-myth/9781541736184/

This week I read [*The Deficit Myth*][deficit]. I'm not finished yet. It's thought-provoking!
Chapter 7 is rather bleak, though. I don't know what I'll read next.

## Last week

Last week I focused on various chores/tasks related to my medium/long-term
life plans. It was pretty boring and sometimes frustrating, but looking back, I did
indeed appear to make decent progress (or at least get more clarity)
on lots of this stuff that I would eventually have had to do anyways.

## What's next

I've been kicking around a business/app idea related to reading
for a few years now, and this week I'm going to start hacking
on it!


# "Sabbatical Update (Week 7)"

  (16 July 2021 to 22 July 2021) Building the Bookworm Club,
  and reading Infinite Powers.






## Reading

[deficit]: https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/stephanie-kelton/the-deficit-myth/9781541736184/
[calculus]: http://www.stevenstrogatz.com/books/infinite-powers

I finished [*The Deficit Myth*][deficit]. On to [*Infinite Powers*][calculus]
by Steven Strogatz. It's a wonderful pop-sci book about the history and
applications of calculus. Learning math(s) was another one of those things
that I've been wanting to do for a long time but could never find the time
or energy for. This book could be the initial inspiration that I needed
to start the journey.

## Last week

Last week I started building the [Bookworm Club](https://bookworm.club).
The gist of the website/app is to make it easier for readers to find
other people all over the world who are reading the same book, so that
they can discuss it together. I'm also creating a blog on that site
where I'll discuss interesting ideas from books that I've read.

## What's next

I'm going to continue working on the Bookworm Club.


# "Sabbatical Update (Week 8)"
date: 2021-07-30
summary: >
  (23 July 2021 to 29 July 2021) Still building the Bookworm Club,
  still reading Infinite Powers, possibly taking on a 1-month
  technical writing contract.






## Reading

[calculus]: http://www.stevenstrogatz.com/books/infinite-powers

I'm about halfway through [*Infinite Powers*][calculus]
by Steven Strogatz. It's still fascinating, enjoyable,
and rewarding.

## Last week

I continued building the [Bookworm Club](https://bookworm.club).
The authentication workflow stuff took longer than expected. I wanted
to do a fancy password-less login workflow, but was disappointed to
eventually realize that Firebase doesn't really support it robustly.
I made decent progress on the Goodreads integration, which was exciting
because it's one of the core ideas of the site.

## What's next

I'm considering taking on a 1-month contract to help a startup with
their docs. It's a tough decision. I may as well go into the details
a bit here for the record.

Pros:

* It sounds fun to help this company.
* I would replenish my savings.
* It may be in my long-term best interest to start building
  up connections so that I can do more contracts like this
  in the future.
* I have a sabbatical project related to technical writing,
  and the experience from this contract will probably produce
  new ideas/insights related to the sabbatical project.

Cons:

* It's the age-old dilemma of sacrificing my time and energy for money.

I've already decided to go for it if we can agree on terms.

In the meantime I'm going to continue working on the Bookworm Club.

I finished [*Infinite Powers*][calculus] by Steven Strogatz. 
It was excellent. On a 5-star scale, it was a 5.
I started reading [*Water: A Very Short Introduction*][water].

## Last week

I continued building the [Bookworm Club](https://bookworm.club).
I have most of the Goodreads logic finished. I'm about halfway done
with the Open Library logic. In general I think I'm about 70% done with
the MVP. I took some detailed notes on the current status of the project,
so that hopefully I can pick it back up without too much loss of context
in a month.

## What's next

As of Thursday I started the 1-month contract which I mentioned in last week's update.
I agreed to work on it for 3 hours every day until 1 September 2021. It was
pretty fun to dig into a new product. I like that the project is constrained to a
single month and that the daily workload is manageable. I like that I'm making
connections in the startup world and helping some other people increase their
odds of success. And it's comforting to replenish my money reserves.

## Last week

I'm working 3 hours every day (7 days a week) on a technical writing contract
until the end of August. I also flew back to San Francisco. I'll be here for
a couple months, at least.

## What's next

I'll be continuing the contract until the end of August. I've got a Python class
starting soon. It's the last class I need to take for my associate's degree
in computer science applications and development. I started that degree years
ago and never finished it. One of my sabbatical goals is to finally be done
with it. I've probably got lots of chores to take care of, also. Such as
getting an FBI background check so that I can establish Brazilian residency.

## What's next

I've got a few days left on the technical writing contract.
I'll be continuing the Python class for the next few months.
On a personal note, my partner's student visa got approved, which gives
us clarity about our medium-term plans. At minimum I now need to book a flight
for her and figure out a place to us to live for the next few months. I've
started to clear out the stuff I left in my mom's storage. In that storage
I have a bunch of journals from the last 5-10 years. I might read through
them and start writing my autobiography.

## Contemplation

This is a reminder to myself that next week will mark 3 months of sabbatical!
I should do some introspection on how it's going.

## Reading

I continued reading [*A Matter Of Degrees*][degrees] by Gino Segre.
As far as popular science books go I'm finding it lacking.
The problem here is that it's a survey of a bunch
of topics loosely related to temperature. The author seems to go
on a lot of tangents and I'm frequently asking myself, "how is this
related to temperature?"

[degrees]: https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/288772/a-matter-of-degrees-by-gino-segre/

## Last week

I finished the technical writing contract and continued the Python class.
My partner's student visa came through so I spent a good chunk of time
finding a short-term place for us in San Francisco and booking a flight
for her.

## What's next

I'm working through all of the Python class homework and reading, way
ahead of schedule. My brother is learning programming and has been hacking
away at an automation project. Every other day or so he walks me through
his code and I help him get unstuck. He's also working on building his
career and I'm helping out there where I can.

## Contemplation

3 months of sabbatical! How's it going?

* Well, it's more like 2.25 or 2.5
  months of sabbatical. As mentioned previously, I took on a technical writing
  contract for 1 month, working 3 hours a day, 7 days a week. For the first
  3 weeks, it was satisfying to learn a new product, and help a company get
  their docs to a solid place. By the last week I was itching to get back to
  my own projects. Psychologically I think it was quite helpful to replenish
  my coffer. Also, it was wonderful to go back to a more traditional technical
  writing role, where a company has a developer product, and the success of
  the company is very clearly tied up with the effectiveness of their docs.
* In general it's really wonderful to just wake up and do whatever
  I want and to be completely removed from work pressure and stress.
* One thing that I'm coming to terms with and learning to accept is that I'll probably
  make less overall progress on my projects than I hoped for. That's because
  they're all taking longer than expected and I'm working less per day than
  expected.
* I like the strategy of picking a project for 1 week and focusing
  on that. I'm at a crucial point where I have to follow through on the
  personal projects that I started at the beginning of the sabbatical.
* I do think the sabbatical is serving its purpose of helping me focus
  more on things that are easy to neglect when you have a full-time job.
  E.g. health, relationships, etc.
* These weekly updates are super helpful. It's great to be able to look
  back and see what was happening week-by-week. Maybe I'll continue this
  practice even after the sabbatical.

I worked through almost all of the interactive textbook for my Python class.
It was boring and tedious but worthwhile because I think I have a pretty solid

## Last week

I attempted to start writing my autobiography. It was a flop.
I couldn't create the motivation needed to start a major new
project. I think I need to do more thinking about my methodology
for creating an autobiography as well as what's in/out of scope.
Aside from that I continued doing the classwork for my
Python class.

## What's next

I am going to work on the Bookworm Club until I ship an MVP.
I think I couldn't motivate myself to work deeply on the
autobiography because of the nagging awareness that I haven't

## Last week

I resumed development of the Bookworm Club. I realized that
the initial website architecture I came up with was just too
weird so I switched it back to a more traditional setup. I was
hesitant to do that because it's yet another delay to shipping
something, but it felt necessary if I'm really going to work on
this project long-term.

My partner is returning to the US from Brazil! I had various
chores around preparing for her return (getting the keys to
our new sublet, packing clothes, and so on). 

The Python class continues. I completed the 3rd partner lab.

## What's next

I don't expect to get much work done next week. I haven't
seen my partner in over a month so we'll probably just want
to enjoy each other's company, explore San Francisco, and
tidy up our new temporary home.

## Last week

My partner flew in on Friday. We haven't seen each other for
over a month so we spent Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday
enjoying each other's company and getting her settled in SF. We
are subleasing a furnished place that overlooks the Panhandle.
We did deep cleaning and tidying on Saturday. On Sunday we went
to the last regular season San Francisco Giants game. It was a
historic game (the Giants finally clinched their division and
broke the franchise record for most regular season wins) and it
was my partner's first time seeing the ballpark so that was a
special experience. I can't remember what we did on Monday and
Tuesday. Aside from some chores I think we walked around Golden
Gate Park a bit and enjoyed the neighborhood around Haight &
Ashbury. On Wednesday I drove with my brother and mom to Joshua
Tree. We rented an Airbnb for her birthday and will be here until
Sunday. I didn't do any work on Bookworm Club. I completed
a quiz for the Python class.

## Last week

On Friday Gabi and I went to Club Deluxe with her classmates.
On Saturday I went into a rabbit hole building a script that gathers
and analyzes the recent earnings surprises for each member of the
Dow Jones Industrial Average. On Friday and Saturday I also completed the
midterm quiz and assignment for my Python class. On Sunday we had an atmospheric
river pass over San Francisco. I put on my rain gear and walked through
Golden Gate Park a bit (watching out for widowmakers, of course). On Monday I
worked out the DNS kinks for the Bookworm Club and built a fun feature
on the sign up page. The placeholder for the email cycles through
fictional email addresses for popular literary characters. I also
built out the [Bets](/bets) section of this website. On
Tuesday I wrote the [Resulting](https://bookworm.club/blog/resulting)
post on Bookworm Club. On Wednesday I battle-hardened Bookworm Club
a bit and enjoyed the Upper Haight neighborhood with Gabi. On Thursday
I did some preparation for Outside Lands and started working on one of
my technical writing projects.

## What's next

On Friday Gabi and I are going to Outside Lands. Saturday is Gabi's
birthday. Sunday is Halloween. I doubt I'll work much those days.
After that I'm going to work on a couple technical writing projects
I've been kicking around.

  (29 October 2021 to 4 November 2021) Reading Where Do We Go From Here,
  enjoying Outside Lands & Gabi's birthday & Halloween, working on the
  Bookworm Club & a few technical writing projects.






## Reading

I continued reading [*Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos Or Community?*][mlk].

[mlk]: http://www.thekinglegacy.org/books/where-do-we-go-here-chaos-or-community

## Last week

On Friday Gabi and I went to Outside Lands. We walked over 30K steps!
Saturday was Gabi's birthday. We got lunch with friends and recovered from Outside Lands.
On Sunday Gabi and I cruised around San Francisco on a Revel moped and walked
around in our ghost costumes. I don't remember what I did on Monday.
On Tuesday I started working on a few technical writing projects. I have
been trying to focus on landing one project at a time, but in this case
it makes more sense to work on all of them simultaneously. Gabi and I also
went to the Legion of Honor and got some beers with 2 of her close friends.
On Wednesday I continued work on the technical writing projects. I also added
an RSS feed for the Bookworm Club. On Thursday I continued working on my
technical writing projects and went down to Palo Alto to celebrate a friend's
birthday.

## What's next

It's time to start planning our wedding! I'll also continue working
on my technical writing projects.

## Last week

On Friday and Saturday I went into a rabbit hole writing a Python script
that helps me identify long volatilty trades. On Sunday Gabi and I watched
Dune (the new movie) with a couple friends. It was amazing! Gabi and I are
now reading the book together. We'll probably see the movie in theaters
again. On Monday I reflected on Dune and secured a date for our wedding
ceremony. On Tuesday I worked on one of my technical writing projects.
I'll call it the template project. I am making a template website that
is optimized for technical documentation. I will be using this template
website as the starting point for future projects. On Wednesday and Thursday
I continued working on the template project and started another technical
writing project, which I'll call the guide project. On Thursday night
Gabi and I went out with a few of my friends.

## What's next

I will continue working on the template and guide projects and kick
our wedding planning into high gear.

## Last week

On Friday I spent quite a few hours doing homework for my Python class.
On Saturday Gabi and I took a bus to the ocean and walked home (through
Golden Gate Park). On Sunday Gabi and I rented a Revel moped (again)
and drove through the Presidio. I didn't work on any projects on Saturday
or Sunday. It was rejuvenating to have 2 days dedicated to rest and relaxation.
On Monday I posted my old [Why salt was so important][salt] post to HN
(again) and it ended up making the front page (again). I pitched the
book club service in the comments and got some registrations! That means
the Bookworm Club got its first legitimate/organic users! I'm now debating
whether I should continue work on the Bookworm Club or proceed with my
technical writing projects. On Tuesday I worked on the Technical Writing
Guide project. On Wednesday and Thursday I resumed wedding planning. On
Thursday night Gabi and I checked out some wedding rings and then went
to the Exploratorium. It was her first time at the Exploratorium
and she loved it! We also had a lovely moped ride from the Exploratorium
back to our home in the Panhandle.

  (19 November 2021 to 25 November 2021) Reading The Maya,
  visiting friends and family, planning the wedding, and
  exploring San Francisco.






## Reading

I continued [*The Maya*][maya]. My general impression of the book is
that it's a major slog. My main issue is that the authors focus too
much on the research methodology behind everything we know about the Maya.
The lesson learned for me here (if I ever write my own book) is to use
traditional narrative/storytelling techniques and explain research methodology
with footnotes or an appendix.

## Last week

On Friday I did chores (e.g. going to the bank) and routine tasks (e.g.
exercising). I have been listening to 2 podcasts: *Uptime Wind Energy
Podcast* and *The Market Huddle*. On Saturday we had a family photo.
A lot of people showed up and it was wonderful seeing everyone again.
On Sunday Gabi and I made a caesar salad (homemade vegan dressing of course)
and went to a Friendsgiving. On Monday I listened to the Marko Papic
episode of the *The Market Huddle*. It was full of so many "aha!" moments.
We secured our wedding ceremony venue. I emailed the first users of the
Bookworm Club about the project's near-term future. On Wednesday Gabi and I
explored San Francisco Botanical Garden. Thursday was Thanksgiving.

## What's next

I will continue planning the wedding and resume work on the Bookworm
Club.

We binge-watched [*Reservation Dogs*][resdogs] and [*Sex Education*][sexed],
cooked a few meals, and took the dogs on some pleasant walks around
the neighborhood. On Tuesday I did some wedding planning. I am interested
in markets again and it's hard to pull away from *Geopolitical Alpha* and
*The Market Huddle*. On Wednesday and Thursday I did more wedding planning
and reviewed/updated my investment portfolio.

died unexpectedly. We're in shock and grieving about that. On Tuesday I
updated some of my [bets](/bets/) and did more wedding planning. On Wednesday
and Thursday I did homework for my Python class and did more wedding
planning.

## Last week

This week I continued routine tasks, like Christmas shopping.
I continued working on my Python scripts that automate some
of my research workflows for macroeconomic investing. I started
exercising again. I picked up a small journal for doodling.
I think I got a Flutter development environment successfully set up.
It was a bit of a slog and required gigabytes of storage space but
I didn't have any really frustrating setup problems.
On Thursday Gabi and I went mushroom hunting in Golden Gate Park.
Later I continued learning how to develop apps with Flutter.

## What's next

I don't know! More wedding planning, probably. Gabi and I
will probably spend most of Friday (Christmas Eve) and Saturday

## Last week

On Friday Gabi and I got the ingredients for guacamole, made
said guacamole, and spent Christmas Eve at my mom's home with
my family. On Saturday we lounged around some more at my mom's.
On Sunday we started dogsitting a dog named Cheese for a week.
It was a bit stressful at first but we're enjoying it now. 
On Monday night I decided to try a 24-hour fast. I didn't quite
make it to 24 hours. It was more like 20 hours. Nonetheless it
was an interesting experience! Throughout the week I continued
learning Flutter development and continued setting up the wedding.
*Entangled Life* has encouraged me to walk around Golden Gate Park
and look for mushrooms. I did that a few times this week.

## What's next

Wedding planning! I am going to try out being more rigorous with
scheduling. I.e. 1 hour for exercise, 1 for programming, etc.
