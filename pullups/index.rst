Pull-ups
========

One of my 2025 goals is to do 3 `pull-ups <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull-up>`__
in a row. My current record is 0 in a row. So by the end of this year I will
hopefully enjoy an âˆž% increase in my ability to do pull-ups.

Here's my plan.

----------
Definition
----------

I'm aiming for 3 full-range-of-motion pull-ups:

#. Grab the bar with my palms away from my body.

#. Start at a dead hang.

#. Pull myself up until my chin is above the bar.

#. Lower myself down until I'm back at a dead hang.

#. Repeat 2 more times.

----------
Strategies
----------

Practice at home
================

It looks like I need to practice at least 3 times a week. The only way
to realistically practice that much is to install a pull-up bar or `gymnastic
rings <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B6C4N3XP/>`_ at home. It sounds like the
gymnastic rings require more muscle activation but are perhaps easier on joints.
I'm going to try both.

I'm aiming for some kind of practice every day. I'll probably give myself at
least a day of rest between intense training sessions.

Lose weight
===========

Another one of my 2025 goals is to lose 15 pounds of weight. Various
sources suggest that shedding extra weight makes pull-ups easier.

Exercises
=========

Dead hangs
----------

First things first, I've got to be able to hang from a pull-up bar
for a while. If each pull-up takes 10 seconds, that means that I'll need
to hang for 30 seconds in order to do 3 pull-ups in a row.

Hang in the bottom position of a pull-up for 30 seconds at least. Work
up to 60 seconds or more.

Scapular pull-ups
-----------------

The first part of the pull-up is the most difficult for me. I just can't
lift my body up those first 12 inches. It sounds like scapular pull-ups
will help me build up the muscles that are needed for the initial movement
of a full pull-up.

From a dead hang, pull the shoulder blades back-and-down, hold it for a few
seconds, and then return to the dead hang.

I've known about this exercise for years and always thought it was easy.
But now I actually suspect that I've been doing it wrong all along.
Earlier today I focused on perfecting my form while my feet were still on
the floor. While holding the down-and-back position I felt quite a burn in
my upper back muscles! This suggests that my upper back muscles were never
actually strong enough to do this exercise while hanging.

Negative pull-ups
-----------------

Most sources suggest that this is the most effective exercise for building
pull-up strength because you're basically exercising all the same muscles
that you need for true pull-ups.

Start at the top of a pull-up position. Hold the top position for 3
seconds at least. Shoulder blades should be down-and-back through the whole
downward movement. Slowly lower down to the bottom position. The downward movement
should take at least 5 seconds. Release the shoulder blades and end in a dead
hang.

Push-ups
--------

After each negative pull-up, I do 2 slow push-ups, focusing on activating
my core muscles.
