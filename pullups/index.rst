Pull-ups

One of my 2025 goals is to do 3 `pull-ups <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull-up>`__
in a row. I currently can't do a single pull-up. Here's my strategy.

----------
Home setup
----------

Install a pull-up bar or `gymnastic rings <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B6C4N3XP/>`_
at home.

-----------
Lose weight
-----------

Lifting 170 pounds of body weight is easier than lifting 185.

----------
Dead hangs
----------

Hang in the bottom position of a pull-up for 30 seconds at least.
This builds grip and forearm strength.

-----------------
Scapular pull-ups
-----------------

From the bottom position of a pull-up, pull the shoulder blades
back and down.

-----------------
Negative pull-ups
-----------------

Start at the top of a pull-up position. Hold the top position for 3
seconds at least. Shoulder blades should be down and back while holding the
top position. Slowly lower down to the bottom position. The downward movement
should take at least 5 seconds.
