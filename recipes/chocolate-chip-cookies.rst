#. Mix the water and flour and set them aside.

#. Melt the butter in a microwave.

#. Mix the butter and sugar in a bowl.

#. Add the flour, cornstarch, and baking soda to the bowl.

#. Roll the cookie dough in golf-ball sized balls and put them on a baking sheet.

Don't leave them in the oven expecting them to get golden brown, because they
won't. They'll dry out if left in the oven for too long.
